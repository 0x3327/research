<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This is the first research paper in the series of research exploring Token Economics and Token Engineering tools and processes. It provides an introduction to the practice and the Process of Token Engineering. It also covers a portion of systems theory and the three most prevalent tools in the field of Token Engineering. These tools are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Machinations - tool token engineers can use in designing Crypto Economic systems in all stages, from System Mapping to Evaluation and improvements on the running system.</li>
<li>cadCad - the package most often used in designing, testing, and validating complex systems through simulation.</li>
<li>TokenSPICE - an EVM Agent-Based Token Simulator written in Python which simulates tokenized ecosystems via an agent-based approach, with EVM “in the loop”.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We as humans are participating in numerous systems in our everyday life. Our families are a system, schools we participate in, markets we shop at, and countries we are residents of all have rules and incentives to get us to comply with their rules and laws. Some incentives are positive (you get paid for your work), and some are negative (steal, and if you are not lucky, you will get caught). Nevertheless, they serve as a guide to the participant’s behavior.</p>
<p>In Web3, we have tokenized decentralized systems that anyone can participate in. Like any other system, the complex socio-economic system that is Web3 system must have rules and limitations to function correctly and according to its purpose. That is why said systems have their own economies to incentivize system participants towards a specific goal. These economies are called Token Economies, as Token is the medium by which transactions happen, and behavior is incentivized. “Tokens represent a part of the state of any cryptoeconomic systems and can be seen as their atomic unit.” - Shermin Voshmgir and Michael Zargham.</p>
<p>A token can cover various functions of money: medium of exchange, store of value, or unit of account. A token can represent anything in the confines of the Web3 tokenized system. But the question here is: How to actually design these tokenized ecosystems? How to analyze said design and simulate it?</p>
<p>This is where the emerging Token Engineering field comes into play.</p>
<p>Token Engineering as a term was first mentioned in 2018. in the paper “Can Blockchains Go Rogue?” by Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol. In the article, he calls blockchains the “incentive machines with the power to get people to do stuff by rewarding with tokens”. Trent McConaghy<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Token engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that draws from systems, electrical, and robotics engineering practices. It also draws from Behavioural and Ecological Economics, AI, and Optimization. Its goal is to create reliable systems that work under varying circumstances and to create tokenomic systems that are exploit-proof. Shermin Voshmgir and Michael Zargham<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: Crypto Economic systems as a cross-disciplinary field</em></p>
<p>As Crypto Economic systems are complex, Token Engineering process includes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ideation and design of the system</li>
<li>Modelling</li>
<li>Simulation</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ol>
<p>This research will cover the process of token engineering and the tools used by token engineers to design, model and evaluate Crypto Economic systems. These tools are Machinations, cadCad and tokenSPICE.</p>

<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The goal of this research is to serve as an introduction to the field of the Token Engineering, the process of Token Engineering and its tools. It will explore the process as a whole. On the tool side, we will examine Machinations, cadCad, and TokenSPICE.</p>
<p>The research will be done by reviewing the documentation of said tools, trying them out, and interviewing the people behind them. We will also interview an experienced Token Engineer to understand how the process is assessed in practice.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steps-in-token-engineering-process">Steps in Token Engineering process</h2>
<p>Below we will present some general steps in the process of Token Engineering.</p>
<section id="system-mapping" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="system-mapping">System Mapping</h3>
<p><strong>Identifying what concepts and constructs are relevant to our model and goals for the system</strong></p>
<p>Before starting the process, we need to take systems thinking approach. In this stage of the design, the engineer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Builds stakeholder taxonomies by identifying stakeholder groups, their possible actions, and the form of their incentives</li>
<li>Lays out the system dynamics and agent goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the tools for system mapping are Cluster Maps and Ecosystem Canvas:</p>
<p><strong>Cluster Maps</strong></p>
<p>The system’s goal is set in the middle of a cluster map while the associated nodes are drawn around it. This is a not-so-rigorous approach and is often used to get an outline of the system engineer is creating.</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/Cluster.jpeg" width="600"></p>
<p><em>Figure 2: Cluster map example</em>@acarogluToolsSystemsThinkers2017</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem canvas</strong></p>
<p>When using this method, the purpose of the system is put at the center while key players are laid out in circles radiating outwards.</p>

<section id="formalising-the-design" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formalising-the-design">Formalising the design</h3>
<p>After the initial phase is the phase of formalizing the design using causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams, there is another tool called Machinations that Token Engineers could use in this step. We will cover Machinations later in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Causal Loop Diagrams</strong></p>
<p>“A causal loop diagram is a”snapshot of all relationships that matter.” It visualizes key variables (i.e., factors, issues, processes) and how they are interconnected. These diagrams show variables represented as texts and causal relationships between them as arrows.” ‘What Is a Causal Loop Diagram and What Is It Good For? | Marketlinks’<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/causal_loop.png" width="600"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Causal Loop Diagram</em></p>
<p>In a Causal Loop Diagram positive relationships are labeled with a plus sign while negative relationships are labeled with a minus sign. Above example is often used to explain this type of diagrams. It shows how market saturation and word of mouth impact potential adopters and adoption rate.</p>
<p><strong>Stock and flow diagrams</strong></p>
<p>Stock and flow diagrams are a more complex way of formalizing the design. You can see below a representation of the simple system using this diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/stock_flow.png" width="600"></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modularising-the-logic-and-model-building">Modularising the logic and model building</h3>
<p>After formalizing the design, system modeling is done using an open-source python package, cadCad. We will cover cadCad in detail in the next section of the paper.</p>
</section>
<section id="refining-the-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="refining-the-model">Refining the model</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, this is the part in the process where the model is refined using quantitative and qualitative backtesting.</p>

<section id="evaluation-and-improvements-on-the-running-system" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation-and-improvements-on-the-running-system">Evaluation and improvements on the running system</h3>
<p>After the system is up and running cadCad model can be used as a “digital twin,” which allows token engineers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>evaluate proposed changes to the system</li>
<li>test the sensitivity of parameters</li>
<li>explore the success criteria and failure modes</li>
<li>evaluate behaviors and policies</li>
<li>make recommendations to governance bodies stephenyo<sup>5</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="machinations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machinations">Machinations</h2>
<p>Machinations is a browser-based tool to design and balance game systems. This tool has seen use from game designers, consultants, developers, and analysts. Token Engineers can also use this tool in designing Crypto Economic systems in stages from System Mapping to Evaluation and improvements on the running system. Machinations shines in pre-production.</p>
<p>Using Machinations, Token Engineer can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map systems in an interactive diagram</li>
<li>Set parameters that define resource flow</li>
<li>Plot and analyze the results in real-time using the chart option</li>
<li>Simulate outcomes for one player journey or stochastically using batch plays</li>
<li>Export outcomes in CSV</li>
<li>Export design parameters to Google Sheets</li>
</ul>
<p>Machinations is uses these types of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pools that collect Resources</li>
<li>Sources that create Resources</li>
<li>Drains that consume/destroy resources</li>
<li>Converters that transmute resources</li>
<li>Gates that redistribute resources</li>
</ul>
<p>And two types of connections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource connections that determine how the Resources flow</li>
<li>State connections that modify the state of diagram elements Dana<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Below you will find a basic diagram created in machinations that can be used to see the flow of an AMM system:</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/Machinations.png" width="600"></p>
<p><em>Figure 6: Machinations diagram example</em></p>
<p>This design was done in less than 20 minutes and represents a basic flow of the user exchanging tokens for crypto using our AMM. The Key takeaway is that machinations, even though its main focus is on game design can be used for the stages of System Mapping and Formalising the design.</p>

<p>cadCad is the package most often used in designing, testing, and validating complex systems through simulation. It supports Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing, and parameter sweeping. cadCad can model systems from agent-based modeling to system dynamic modeling. It can easily be integrated with other Python modules and data science workflows. But first, let’s briefly explain what these methods are:</p>
<p>“Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.” ‘What Is a Monte Carlo Simulation?’<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>“A/B Testing is a method to compare two (or more) variations of something and determine which one works better. In this method, users are randomly assigned to one of two variants. A statistical analysis is performed to determine which variation performs better for a defined business goal.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>“In modeling, parameter sweeps are an important method for fine-tuning parameter values, exploring parameter space, and calibrating simulations to data. A parameter sweep is an iterative process in which simulations are run repeatedly using different values of the parameter(s) of choice. This process enables the modeler to determine a parameter’s”best” value (or range of values), or even where in parameter space the model produces desirable (or non-desirable) behaviors.” ‘Parameter Sweeps and Model Iteration Idmtools Documentation’<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Although it can be used to simulate any system that can be described as state variables that evolve over time according to a set of equations, cadCad has seen the most use in the Token Engineering process.</p>
<p>The first step in modeling using cadCad is the Visual System mapping we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Afterward, the next step is Mathematical specification using differential equations. For example, we will use the simple system of sheep from the cadCad introduction course:</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/sheeps.png" width="600"></p>
<p>Here we set the initial differential equations for our model. It is self explanatory. Population growth depends on food sources.</p>
<p><em>Note: This is a simplified model used to for demonstration, Crypto Economy equations are much more complex</em></p>
<p>Afterwards, the Modelling and simulation process in general works like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/cadcad-flow.png" style="width:50.0%;height:50.0%"></p>
<p><em>Figure 7: cadCad processes</em></p>
<p>We will briefly explain the steps without going into code examples as we will cover plenty of code examples in future research papers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, the engineer defines all the state variables in the system and their initial values (they can be of any Python data type)</li>
<li>Afterwards, the variables that impact the behavior of the model.</li>
<li>Policy functions compute one or more signals to be passed to state update functions. They are used to describe the logic and behavior of a system component.</li>
<li>State update functions are then designed to define how the model changes over time.</li>
<li>Partial state update blocks are used for composing state update functions and policy functions in series or parallel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Simulation process steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the configuration stage, engineer ties all the model compenents using “config_sim” and chooses how the simulation should run:
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of times it will run</li>
<li>The number of timesteps the simulation will run for</li>
<li>The parameters of the system</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Execution computes the simulation output</li>
<li>Output preparation is the process in which data is manipulated and analyzed in order to answer questions about the model.</li>
<li>Analysis is self explanatory - engineer evaluates the model performance and if there is a need, improves the model. Usually that is the case as the first model is almost always not the optimal one.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see cadCad covers the entire Token Engineering process with help from stock and flow diagrams and system mapping tools. We will cover this library and its functionalities in great detail in future research papers.</p>
</section>
<section id="tokenspice" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tokenspice">TokenSPICE</h2>
<p>TokenSPICE is an EVM Agent-Based Token Simulator written in Python, which simulates tokenized ecosystems via an agent-based approach, with EVM “in the loop”.</p>
<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a computation engine which acts like a decentralized computer that has millions of executable projects. It acts as the virtual machine which is the bedrock of Ethereum’s entire operating structure. ‘Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) | CoinMarketCap’<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>TokenSPICE has been mainly used in later stage analysis and for verifying and tuning the system designs.</p>
<p>Agent-based modeling focuses on the individual active components of a system. Agents in tokenSPICE can be DAOs, unique users, and other protocols, making it a versatile tool.</p>
<p>It can be used in Token Engineering flows to design, tune and verify tokenized ecosystems.</p>
<p>If the engineer wants to model on the smart contract code directly and skip the equations set up like in cadCad, then the tokenSPICE is the tool of choice.</p>
<p>It uses Brownie, which treats smart contracts as classes, making it easier to run simulations. It also requires less work upfront in contrast to cadCad. Write the contracts in Solidity, then simulate with tokenSPICE.</p>
<p>When you run the simulator, the run function in SimEngine.py is triggered and starts the run loop in it:</p>

<p>The rest of the file is dedicated to logging the results into CSV format, and we will not examine it further.</p>
<p>Similarly, the simulation engine also takes a step when the Agents take a step in the simulation.</p>
<p>Simulation with tokenSPICE can be done using the following command in the terminal and the results can saved in CSV or a plot created in png:</p>
<pre><code>  tsp plot netlists/scheduler/netlist.py outdir_csv outdir_png</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: Netlists are just agents “wired-up”</em></p>
<p>Here we ran a vesting simulation in the Ocean protocol and this is the resulting plot:</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-246/vesting.png" width="600"></p>
<p><em>Figure 8: Vesting simulation in tokenSPICE</em></p>
<p>You can run all kinds of netlists in order to get a “feel” of it, in the tokenSPICE <a href="https://github.com/tokenspice/tokenspice">official GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast to cadCad, which can be used for any type of system, tokenSPICE is focused on EVM systems and incentives. The main difference is that cadCad is mainly used in the early-stage design of systems.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Token Engineering as a field is still young, and the community around it is still tiny. However, the quality of tools available is exceptional. The tools range from general game design tools (Machinations) and general system design tools (cadCad) to specialized tools like tokenSPICE. The only missing piece of the puzzle are the Token Engineers, who will focus on mastering these tools to provide valuable insights into both designing and validating crypto-economic systems.</p>
<p>You can see the list of all possible tools for system modeling with tokens, and their strengths and weaknesses <a href="https://github.com/TokenEngineeringCommunity/summary-of-tools/blob/main/README.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>Considering the complex nature of systems in Web3, we have only discovered the tip of the iceberg and the picks to dig deeper and examine the economies of this vast ecosystem.</p>

  <title>[ERFC - 315] Reaching Towards Realtime in Blockchain</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The concept of <strong>Real-Time</strong> can be best explained as a set of guarantees that are given and that need to be met within a predetermined time period. Usually, though not necessarily, this is a short time period. In the case the guarantees are not met before the deadline has been reached, then the performance of the real-time system either degrades or the system has failed completely.</p>
<p>For a blockchain to achieve real-time operations, it has to have low latency and indirectly a high throughput, hopefully without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p>
<p>This is a problem of scaling a blockchain, and several approaches exist, each with its advantages and limitations. These approaches can be grouped into <strong>on-chain</strong> and <strong>off-chain</strong> scaling solutions, with the main difference being whether there exist a need for changing the blockchain’s protocol in some way.</p>
<p>The main focus of this research is put on the off-chain scaling in the Ethereum Ecosystem and how can a Decentralized Application (DApp) potentially achieve something that resembles real-time operations.</p>
<p>The research proposes a framework consisting of an off-chain and on-chain part where the on-chain part would be used to enforce rules that the off-chain code needs to honor.</p>
<p>The ideas proposed here would need to be expanded upon and thoroughly tested in real-world conditions to completely assess their practical significance.</p>
<p>Further research should also take into consideration on-chain scaling, namely ETH2.0, as well as an exciting concept of creating a network of private sovereign blockchains built specifically for the DApp’s needs.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<section id="ethereums-layer-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ethereums-layer-1">Ethereum’s Layer 1</h2>
<p>Ethereum blockchain, as defined in,<sup>1</sup> can be viewed as a “transaction-based state machine” that groups transactions into blocks which are then sequentially executed in the order that was set by the block’s creator - miner.</p>
<p>Before being included inside a block, the transactions reside in the pending transaction pool. Miners have complete control over what transactions get included and in what order. Each transaction advances the chain’s state for which the miners are rewarded fees paid by the Externally-Owned-Account(EOA)* that initiated the transaction.</p>
<p>In essence, the more the EOA is willing to pay for the service of including their transaction, the more likely it is will be included in the next block. This creates the problem in the situation of blockchain’s network congestion - as the transactions are being created at a faster rate than they can be processed, fees drastically increase, and it becomes a competition between different EOAs, which leads to a bad user experience.</p>
<p>To ease the load put on the Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1 - L1) chain and effectively perform scaling, multiple approaches exist: Sidechains and schemes commonly referred to as Layer 2 (L2) solutions. L2 solutions include State Channels, Plasma, and Rollups (Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge based).</p>
<p>* Ethereum account can be defined as a private-public keypair mapped to an address. EOA is a type of an Ethereum account where the private key is known and “externally” controlled, in contrast to smart contract accounts where the private key is not known, and only the address exists.</p>
</section>
<section id="off-chain-scaling-approaches" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="off-chain-scaling-approaches">Off-chain Scaling Approaches</h2>
<p>When considering approaches to Ethereum’s scaling problem, this paper considers only Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible sidechains and optimistic rollups.</p>
<section id="sidechains" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sidechains">Sidechains</h3>
<p>Sidechains are completely independent parallel blockchains to the Ethereum’s L1, with which they can communicate over two-way bridges. They introduce their own set of parameters and operate on different rules.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>, a popular Ethereum sidechain, uses Proof-of-Stake for its consensus mechanism, with block times being around 2.3 seconds<sup>2</sup> (Ethereum’s average block time is between 12 and 14 seconds)<sup>3</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="optimistic-rollups" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimistic-rollups">Optimistic Rollups</h3>
<p>Unlike Sidechains, Optimistic Rollups have their security rooted in the L1 chain.</p>
<p>As Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum discusses in<sup>4</sup> :</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Instead of putting all activity on the blockchain directly, users perform the bulk of their activity off-chain in a”layer 2” protocol. There is a smart contract on-chain, which only has two tasks: processing deposits and withdrawals and verifying proofs that everything happening off-chain is following the rules. There are multiple ways to do these proofs, but they all share the property that verifying the proofs on-chain is much cheaper than doing the original computation off-chain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Optimistic Rollups, after a state is proposed, there exists a period where it can be disputed, after which it cannot be longer challenged.</p>
<p>While anyone can propose a state, one of the optimistic rollups - <a href="https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/inside_arbitrum">Arbitrum One</a> chain has used a concept of a “sequencer”<sup>5</sup>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The sequencer is a specially designated full node, which is given limited power to control the ordering of transactions. This allows the sequencer to guarantee the results of user transactions immediately, without needing to wait for anything to happen on Ethereum. So no need to wait five minutes or so for block confirmations–and no need to even wait 15 seconds for Ethereum to make a block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company behind Arbitrum has recently introduced another L2 concept chain - AnyTrust Chains<sup>6</sup>, which is operated by a “committee” of nodes signing the state that will later be put on-chain. If nodes go offline or refuse to cooperate, the chain reverts to a standard protocol.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="bridges-and-cross-chain-applications" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridges-and-cross-chain-applications">Bridges and Cross-chain Applications</h2>
<p>To enable cross-chain communication, there exist Bridges with the purpose of transferring assets and passing messages. The benefit of bridges is that users can move to a different chain if their needs require it. For example, when either transaction cost is too high or when there is more of a specific user activity going on the target chain - i.e., Non-Fungible Token (NFT) trading.</p>
<p>Bridges operate between two extremes - trusted (there is a centralized entity that is being <em>trusted</em>) and trustless (there is no need for the centralized entity).<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>The security of bridges, however, remains troublesome. As Buterin has pointed out in,<sup>8</sup> in the case of a 51% attack of the chain from which funds are being moved, attacker can broadcast a transaction that deposits some funds to the target chain and then revert it, as soon the assets are minted on the target chain. He states that:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“… while I am optimistic about a multi-chain blockchain ecosystem (there really are a few separate communities with different values and it’s better for them to live separately than all fight over influence on the same thing), I am pessimistic about cross-chain applications.”</p>
</blockquote>
<section id="application-specific-blockchains" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application-specific-blockchains">Application-specific Blockchains</h3>
<p>Instead of having all applications competing for the same resources, a DApp can run its own blockchain. There can exist inter-communication between those private and public chains through bridges.</p>
<p>Each chain operates with a unique set of rules and validators - making them sovereign but less decentralized.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="concept-of-time-in-blockchains" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concept-of-time-in-blockchains">Concept of Time in Blockchains</h2>
<p>Blockchains operate in discrete time as the state is advanced only when a block is created and validated. It is worth noting that Ethereum’s Yellow Paper[2] states only that the current block’s timestamp should be strictly greater than its predecessor’s timestamp - not what’s the maximum difference between those two values.</p>
<p>This leads to blocks being produced at non-constant time intervals and the concept of time being distorted. When periods and deadlines are mentioned in this paper, it is meant in terms of block numbers.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>This paper tries to give a thought framework and a set of underlying principles that can be used to create a DApp that comes as close to real-time operations as possible.</p>
<p>It considers only EVM compatible chains when doing this and reasons how their properties can enable those operations.</p>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>The main ideas presented in this research are the separation of DApp’s functionality into parallel processes of different priorities while providing guarantees that a part of the process will be executed in a predefined period.</p>
<p>It breaks the DApp into its <strong>on-chain code</strong> (a set of smart contracts) and <strong>off-chain code</strong> (operates under rules imposed by the on-chain part).</p>
<section id="on-chain-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-chain-code">On-chain code</h2>
<section id="parallezization-of-processes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="parallezization-of-processes">Parallezization of Processes</h3>
<p>Rather than separating DApp’s functionality into different contract methods with only one method being called per transaction, it is possible to have one method capable of executing different sequences of method calls and accomplishing more.</p>
<p>In the example shown below, there exist three separate processes(P0, P1, P2) that perform operations on the same set of data. Processes P0 and P1 are independent of each other and have no other dependencies (if EVM allowed concurrency, they could be executed in parallel). P2 is, however dependent on P0 and so before calling P2 we need to call P0.</p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>contract Example_0 {

    ...

    function execute (uint[] operation, uint[] data_0) public onlyAdmin returns (bool) {

        for (uint i = 0; i &lt; operation.length; ++i){

            if (operation[i] == 0){

                //P0 : calculate the sum of numbers in `data_0` and put in the `sum` storage variable

            } else if (operation[i] == 1){

                //P1 : store the entire `data_0` into the storage variable `buffer`

            } else if (operation[i] == 2){

                //P2 : if the `sum` even returns 'true'

            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>This setup allows us to create “programmable” sequences of operations and a higher degree of freedom. We can call the <code>execute</code> function with its <code>operation</code> argument set to [0, 2], [1], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2] or [0, 1, 2]. We could also execute a single process multiple times by repeating a number corresponding to the process, though in the example above, that would not make much sense.</p>
</section>
<section id="persistence-across-transactions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="persistence-across-transactions">Persistence across Transactions</h3>
<p>In the previous example, everything happens in the context of one single transaction, but it doesn’t have to. There can exist another process - P3 that would read from the <code>buffer</code> variable and perform a different operation on its data. Now the order of operations becomes even more important. Because P3 reads from the <code>buffer</code>, we could first call P1 that stores the <code>data_0</code> into the <code>buffer</code> and then P3 or first call P3 and after P1, which would exhibit a completely different behavior.</p>
</section>
<section id="prioritization-of-processes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prioritization-of-processes">Prioritization of Processes</h3>
<p>It is obvious that there are limitations to this approach - transaction size and the transaction cost. This is where prioritization comes in, as not all processes are created equal - some need to be executed more frequently in a shorter period of time while others are less important and can have higher latency. It is up to the DApp’s off-chain code to monitor, decide and optimize for the right moment when a process should be executed.</p>
</section>
<section id="providing-guarantees-committing-to-promises" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="providing-guarantees-committing-to-promises">Providing Guarantees: Committing to Promises</h3>
<p>Processes can depend upon each other; that is, they depend on the result(state) produced by previously executed processes. As there is so much that can fit into a single transaction, DApp doesn’t have to execute a process and produce a result right away - it can make a claim about that result and simultaneously commit to the promise that it will justify the claim later.</p>
</section>
<section id="honoring-commitments" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="honoring-commitments">Honoring Commitments</h3>
<p>Commitments made obviously need to be honored. Otherwise, there is no point. If the deadlines are not met, DApp should be penalized, and the users affected should be compensated.</p>
<p>However, there is no direct reason to halt the execution of the processes - they can operate on claims. The issue now becomes that they effectively act on promises - if it is found later on that the claim has not been honored, the processes and all of their results should be affected as well. An example of this dependency is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-315/OperatingOnPromises.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Figure 1: Operating on Claims</p>
</center>
<p>For simplicity, states (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4) are just <code>uint</code> variables, while P0 and P1 are addition and multiplication operations, respectively. The yellow color indicates that a claim has been made for that variable, while green says that the claim has been honored. We see that claiming S0 affects S2 and S4.</p>
<p>It gets even more complicated when a process operates on and produces an update to the same variable. For instance, in Figure 1, if the S2 is fixed to always be equal to S0. The on-chain code would need to keep track of what is affected if the specific claim will not be honored.</p>
<p>How to effectively implement mechanisms that would take into account all of these concerns should be part of separate research.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="off-chain-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="off-chain-code">Off-chain code</h2>
<p>Off-chain code’s responsibility can be summed up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor the state of the contract and all of the commitments that need to be honored</li>
<li>decide what to put inside the transaction by predicting when is the best time to execute a process</li>
</ul>
<section id="monitoring-the-on-chain-activity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monitoring-the-on-chain-activity">Monitoring the on-chain activity</h3>
<p>In the case where only the admin account can alter the contract’s state, off-chain code can maintain a separate record offline that will periodically be checked with the actual state read from the chain. If it is possible for users to interact directly with the contract, then the chain needs to be read more often - one approach would be to parse the blocks as soon as they are validated.</p>
</section>
<section id="optimization-of-action-sequences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimization-of-action-sequences">Optimization of action sequences</h3>
<p>Deciding on how to structure a transaction is a more complex problem, and its main part resides in the scheduling of processes. When should a specific process be scheduled depends on what claims need to be honored and when, as well as the state of the network. If the demand for the network’s resources is high, the execution cost is high as well, so it is better to issue a transaction that will use a lot of resources when the demand becomes lower. However, there is no formal guarantee when a transaction will be mined; there would need to exist models that would try to predict and speculate how the demand will change over time and how much to incentivize the miners.</p>
<section id="bursts-of-transcatiions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bursts-of-transcatiions">Bursts of transcatiions</h4>
<p>Another important concept is that an EOA can create multiple transactions that can be included in the same block. The miner needs to honor only the order in which they are issued.<sup>9</sup> This can be used to enable “bursts” of transactions in order to catch up with the claims that are pending. If there are multiple accounts interacting with the contract, then the order is not guaranteed so there would need to exist some form of synchronization across transactions.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This research has defined a set of principles on how an individual DApp can be structured in order to more effectively distribute its functionality. The ideas proposed have not been tested in practice, so there exists a cloud of doubt about whether this approach is generalizable and sufficient for a large number of DApps.</p>
<p>The research has operated on the assumption that only the DApp’s admin account can alter the on-chain state of a contract, whether by aggregating** the users’ activity or by issuing commands that are made possible by on-chain code. There exist a problem of what happens if the DApp’s off-chain code goes offline, the users should not suffer for it, and so there needs to exist a mechanism that would enable the users to alter the contract’s state as well, which introduces more complexities in the DApp’s design.</p>
<p>The main proposed direction for further research is taking an existing real-world DApp and restructuring its code to enable “parallelization”. Also, as everything is dependent on the off-chain’s code correct scheduling of actions studies and simulations would need to be conducted based on a specific chain’s properties to see how much a chain can handle in terms of the block size, block time, transaction’s execution cost…</p>
<p>Another direction would be Ethereum’s on-chain scaling solution - ETH 2.0, as well as private chains and non-EVM chains and their approaches.</p>
<p>**By collecting signed messages from users that correspond to the action that the user wants to make. This, however, introduces the potential for censorship as well as manipulation when a message will be included in a transaction (both in terms of block numbers and in terms of ordering of messages).</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>When we look at the current Web2 user identity solutions, we can see that they are mostly linked to centralized corporate organizations. Although convenient for the end-user, this type of online identity is not owned by the user, and the issuers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) have complete control of them. In Web3, the focus is on decentralization; however, the problem of cross-chain interoperability of identities is a big one to overcome.</p>
<p>This paper examines the current state of cross-chain identity solutions and the technology behind them to understand how they operate and tackle the previously mentioned interoperability problem. Those solutions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Litentry - a decentralized cross-chain identity aggregator which enables linking user identities across multiple networks. Litentry collects, indexes, and distributes DIDs to blockchains in a decentralized way.</li>
<li>ORE - a cross-chain global identity registry where users have control over their own identity.</li>
<li>Accumulate (mainnet launch planned for September 2022) - an identity-based, delegated proof-of-stake blockchain solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also shortly covers Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Accumulate Digital Identifiers (ADIs), tests and analyzes the project’s solutions and current place in the Web3 market.</p>
<p>This paper does not cover Web3 identity solutions that are not cross-chain, as that is not the main focus of this research.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In Web2, most users’ online identities are linked to centralized corporate organizations like Facebook, Twitter, or Google. The problem with this type of identity is that these organizations “own” your identity on the platform and the associated data. That means that the ease of use (single click logins, app interoperability, etc.) often comes with the price mentioned above. Corporate organizations can close and ban users’ accounts and sell their data which has been the case before. As they have all the data from the user, they can (technically) also generate credentials and log into any website using the user’s identity. ‘Thousands of Leaked Facebook Documents Show Mark Zuckerberg as “Master of Leverage” in Plan to Trade User Data’<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Web3 is based on blockchain technology. Aside from use in financial applications, blockchain can be used in creating and managing Self-sovereign digital identities, like SSIs. SSI is a digital identity concept in which an individual or company has complete control over their account and personal data. ‘Self-Sovereign Identities’<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The identity means nothing without claims from trusted sources (government ID credentials, student ID credentials, library card certificates). If many trusted parties assign claims to identity, thus implicitly confirming it, then the identity is valid. We use our ID number, issued by the government, anywhere, and every organization in the country will accept our identity number as it was issued by the trusted party confirming the identity. The validity of the identity is not in the keys, but the claims and the keys are there to verify that we indeed hold those claims.</p>
<p>Currently, when it comes to creating identity in Web3, we have various “approaches” to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user’s public key can be seen as a kind of identity on the blockchain. However, it is not very user-friendly, and it is limited in terms of cross-chain interoperability and in terms of representing a user. Users can own multiple addresses, thus having multiple “identities.”</li>
<li>In terms of creating an identity on the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum Naming Service is the most used. ENS’s job is to map human-readable names like ‘3327.eth’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS addresses can represent the user’s identity and be a kind of a user’s profile with its subdomains.</li>
<li>Various identity aggregators like Litentry, IDX, Accumulate, ORE network (this is debatable), etc.</li>
<li>SBTs and soul accounts are also proposed as a possible solution for an identity standard. However, they are currently a concept. They could evolve and become the standard someday.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>This research will explore current solutions for creating a cross-chain Web3 identity (aggregators, protocols). After mapping the solutions, this research will propose the next steps in tackling this issue.</p>
<p>This paper will tackle this topic by reviewing various cross-chain solutions’ documentation and whitepapers and exploring their properties, implementation, and differences.</p>
<p>This paper will not be covering Web3 identity solutions that are not cross-chain.</p>

<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>Below we will discuss some of the current solutions that are trying to tackle cross-chain identity.</p>
<section id="litentry---identity-aggregator" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="litentry---identity-aggregator">Litentry - identity aggregator</h2>
<p>Litentry is a decentralized cross-chain identity aggregator which enables linking user identities across multiple networks. Litentry collects, indexes, and distributes DIDs to blockchains in a decentralized way.</p>
<p>Aggregation is the process of integrating a wide range of digital identities from multiple networks.</p>
<p>“Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID.” DIDs, by design, allow the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. ‘Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) V1.0’<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Litentry’s main selling point is its decentralized identity and user activity data aggregation infrastructure. It is built on Substrate network.</p>
<p>Protocols could use identity aggregating service for collateralized lending, DeFi insurance rate, and DAO voting power calculations, preventing bots from getting airdrops and various other uses in dApps.</p>
<p>Main features of Litentry:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identity management - The primary focus of this platform are identities. Litentry provides anonymous and independent identities from applications and services used by the user.</li>
<li>Identity Staking - As well as staking tokens and earning, users can “stake” their identity and get rewards.</li>
<li>Distributed storage of identity data.</li>
<li>Users do not need to create multiple accounts to use different platforms of services. They can use one identity to interact with various services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using Litentry, blockchain projects can “offer” special services to users based on their identity’s quantified data.</p>
<p>“For example, if a new project knows that an account is a Polkadot validator, and it spends hundreds of DOTs on another Parachain for half a year, then the project could directly gift this specific user some token to start to play with, or send him/her an attractive offer of the new DeFi product, or accredit him to be a validated voter.” Litentry<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>It features an identity matching and identity staking mechanism, which are at the very core of the Litentry model. But what do they represent exactly?</p>
<p>Identity Matching is blind matchmaking where random anonymous identities are picked from the on-chain pool of identities, and the substrate off-chain worker processes candidate identity data. The network sends the matchwinners DID as a matching opportunity back to the matching buyer (for example, dApp that wants to do an airdrop). The buyer only has access to the matchwinner’s DID; thus match buyer pays the LIT token in exchange for a matching opportunity.</p>
<p>When it comes to identity staking, that is the process in which an identity owner sends the snapshot of their identity document and DID to the identities pool of blockchain and authorizes the read permissions to the validator node. The owner gets staking and matching rewards in the following blocks. The document is encrypted and stored on IPFS or on the on-chain key-value store. DID is stored on-chain.</p>
<p>Litentry’s use cases and platforms that cover these use cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>TaskFi &amp; Airdrops Whitelisting - Not yet implemented (Drop3 Platform)</li>
</ol>
<p>Litentry identity verification system enables Web3 projects to identify target users and filter out bots. It also has a mechanism where users need to complete the task and then get rewarded after the task is complete.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Social interaction (My Crypto Profile)</li>
</ol>
<p>Using Litentry’s cross-chain capabilities, this platform enables users to generate proof of ownership of various accounts and create a unique identity graph that connects accounts and addresses from Ethereum, Binance, Polkadot, Kusama, Phala, Twitter, and Github into a <strong>unique</strong> Web3 identity. This identity can grant access to various dApps and Airdrops. ‘My Crypto Profile | 0x4d52f8d989796ffde311da9ad696258d5a7b3cc5’<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>“Each ID graph is extracted by ID pairs. An ID pair is made of two decentralized verifiable ownership claims. Each ID pair claims the joint ownership of two accounts, it can be a pairing of two web3 addresses, or a pairing of a web3 address and a web2 account. Everyone can verify and trust the ID pair. Each ID graph is represented in its unique DID. For ID graphs that have a common crypto address, one ID graph will be merged into the other ID graphs and keep only one MCP DID.” - Litentry ‘Identity Graph’<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Token economy:</p>
<p>Suppose we look at the price of LIT token, which is $0.7227 at the time of writing. Litentry reached an all-time high of $14.79 on Feb 16, 2021. Currently, it’s down -95.11% since its record high.</p>
<p>From the market cap of just $26,979,670 we can see that Litentry hasn’t gained much attention or traction as a solution.</p>

<section id="ore-id---identity-registry" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ore-id---identity-registry">ORE ID - identity registry</h2>
<p>Developed by Aikon, ORE is a cross-chain global identity registry where users have control over their own identity. This registry is stored on the ORE blockchain. Users can use ORE ID as a single sign-on to manage their wallets on multiple public blockchains. Single ORE ID account can be used as a wallet on multiple chains because ORE ID accounts hold public and private keypairs for ED 25519, SR25519, and SECP256K1 and SECP256R1 encryption curves.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Picture 4: ORE ID account creation process</em></p>
<p>“Given how sensitive this data is, we use a Trustless Signing Service that allows a user to decrypt their keys and send a signed transaction to various blockchains using ChainJS library. Both of these modules are open source, so any developer can audit the code.” - <a href="https://ore.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ORE-Whitepaper-2.0.pdf">ORE network’s whitepaper</a></p>
<p>ORE ID allows users to access various dApps with a one-click sign-up experience. Users can use social logins of their choosing. ORE ID creates blockchain accounts for the end-user when they sign up and encrypts and stores the user’s private key with their chosen PIN. ORE ID accounts are currently exportable to Scatter Wallet.</p>
<p>When developing an app that uses ORE ID accounts, developers need to register the app and the app logo in order to get their APP-ID and API-key. Documentation is well written and can be found <a href="https://github.com/TeamAikon/oreid">here</a>.</p>
<p>ORE ID operates differently from Litentry as it creates an account that works on multiple chains - it does not aggregate the existing addresses.</p>
<p>Token economy and future of ORE ID:</p>
<p>This project, although an interesting concept, with its market cap of only $ 319,175 doesn’t look like a solution for cross-chain identities and onboarding new users. The current price is $ 0.007984, while its all-time-high was $ 0.320. After testing the ORE ID, it seems that the project has been neglected.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accumulate---mainnet-launch-planned-for-september-2022">Accumulate - mainnet launch planned for September 2022</h2>
<p>Accumulate is an identity-based, delegated proof-of-stake blockchain solution. It plans on creating a universal communication and audit layer for individuals, entities, and blockchains to transact with each other using their version of identifiers that adhere to W3C standards: Accumulate Digital Identifiers (ADIs).</p>
<p>ADIs are human-readable addresses that users choose to represent their presence on the blockchain. Using ADIs accumulate can serve as a communication and audit layer between blockchains, enabling the transfer of tokens between different chains, no matter the consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>ADIs are made of a collection of independent sub-chains. They are managed by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Token accounts - Issuing tokens and tracking deposits and withdrawals from a token account.</li>
<li>Data accounts - Tracking and organizing data.</li>
<li>Staking accounts - Staking ACME tokens to participate in consensus.</li>
<li>Scratch accounts - Accruing data that is needed to build consensus.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accumulate Innovations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Identity - Accumulate is centered around ADIs where each ADI defines its own state that is independent of other ADIs. Each ADI has its own state and set of accounts and chains. They can be updated independently. They are distributed over a set of Tendermint networks.</li>
<li>Synthetic Transactions - Because each ADI has its state, transactions that are routed to an ADI must be processed independently of all other ADIs. Accumulate generates another transaction that performs settlements within an ADI. These transactions are called synthetic since the protocol generates them in response to the transactions initiated by the user.<br>
</li>
<li>Scratch Accounts - Accumulate provides scratch accounts, which reduce the cost of using the blockchain for consensus building. “Scratch accounts allow processes to provide cryptographic proof of validation and process without overburdening the blockchain” - Accumulate Whitepaper ‘Whitepaper - Accumulate’<sup>8</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Integrations:</p>
<p>Accumulate protocol supports various smart contract roll-ups. This allows Accumulate to track the state and validity of contracts on third-party chains. Using Accumulate, organizations can process smart contracts across various layer one protocols (Solana, Ethereum, Tezus).</p>
<p>Accumulate also plans on integrating with Layer-0 protocols, for example, Cosmos and Polkadot. In that case, Accumulate can be utilized to manage the transferred asset under the identity (ADI) of a buyer and to continue tracking the assets across multiple chains.</p>
<p>Technical overview:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-248/Accumulate.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><em>Picture 5: Accumulate system overview</em></p>
<p>In contrast to the traditional blockchain, where architecture is centered around blocks, Accumulate is centered around accounts. Each account is treated as an independent chain and managed as a growing Merkle tree, and blocks are treated as a synchronization point for all chains in the networks.</p>
<p>Inside the Directory Network and Block Validator Networks is the interconnected network of chains responsible for collecting signatures, communicating with each other, and anchoring roots to other blockchains.</p>
<p>These chains are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Signature chain, which collects signatures for a period of 2 weeks</li>
<li>Main chain which records transactions in the origin account and accounts that are modified by the transactions</li>
<li>Synthetic Transaction chain, which is used to store cryptographic proof that a synthetic transaction was actually produced by a particular BVN.</li>
<li>Binary Patricia Trie, which collects hashes of the current state and history of accounts in BVN and DN.</li>
<li>Root Anchor Chain - collects an anchor once per block from every account and system chain updated during the block.</li>
<li>Intermediate Anchor Chain: Within the Directory Network, this chain collects anchors from the Root Anchor chain of every Block Validator Network once per block.</li>
</ol>
<p>As our topic is identity we will focus more on the account and identity architecture of Accumulate, which is actually at the very core of this protocol:</p>
<p>Accumulate supports these accounts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lite Token Account - Traditional address whose URL contains a public key hash and human-readable suffix denoting the token or a data type held by the account. When tokens are sent to this account, the account is created if it doesn’t exist. Users can create a key and have a trusted party send tokens to their URL.</li>
<li>Lite Data Account - It is used for collaboration with Factom protocol. Lite Data Accounts are similar to token accounts, but they are limited to writing data.</li>
<li>Accumulate Digital Identifier (ADI) - Primary unit of organization within Accumulate. ADIs can issue their tokens.</li>
<li>Key book and Key Page - Belongs to an ADI and is used for key management.</li>
<li>ADI Token and Data Accounts are explained at the beginning of the topic</li>
</ol>
<p>Identity architecture:</p>
<p>Users can participate in the network through ADIs and Lite Accounts. ADIs give users access to smart contracts, off-chain consensus building, and dynamic key management. Lite Token and Data Accounts are just a “lite” version of ADIs.</p>
<p>ADIs can only be created through the spending of Credits issued through the Accumulate protocol. Users can also use their ADI to sponsor the creation of other ADIs for themselves or others. These identities can govern token issuance, off-chain consensus building, and multisig signatures.</p>
<p>“ADI Data and Token Account URLs have the general format <code>acc://&lt;ADI&gt;/&lt;directory&gt;/&lt;account&gt;</code> where the prefix acc : // specifies the Accumulate blockchain, ADI specifies the toplevel identity in control of the URL, directory specifies a particular type of account, and account specifies data or tokens.” - Accumulate Whitepaper.</p>
<p>We will not venture deeper into the protocol architecture as it is reasonably complex and goes well beyond this research topic. The main takeaway is that it aims to create cross-chain transaction-compatible accounts using ADIs. The details of a way how this will work in practice are not covered in the whitepaper.</p>
<p>This project is still in development, which means the practical implementations of the concepts presented in the whitepaper are still under the big question mark sign.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We can see from the explored “solutions” that tackling cross-chain identity problems in Web3 is not an easy task. Many projects emerged but fell victim to their lousy architecture and the general public’s low interest. Different blockchains use different hash functions, making creating a standardized cross-chain identity hard. SBTs, a newly proposed solution by E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin aim to solve the problem of Web3 identities by creating a new standard. In their paper Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul, they propose a new solution: Soul Accounts and Soul Bound Tokens. However, there is no talk about Soul accounts being compatible with multiple chains. For more information, see ERFC-261, which we already covered in that paper. However, the concept of creating custom identity systems like the ones above mentioned is an exciting topic, and we think it should be looked into further, regardless of whether building a cross-chain identity or not.</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>NFTs are growing in popularity, and so are the numbers of transactions for transferring the NFTs on the Blockchain. One of the main features of the Blockchain is privacy, but only in terms of pseudo-anonymity. The pseudo-anonymity implies that the user creating the transaction is hidden, as he is represented using an opaque, pseudo-random address. Still, the transactions between the addresses are transparent. By analyzing the transaction graph and external inputs, such as social network posts putting the address in a specific context, it is possible to deduce the address owner and reveal all his transactions. This research aims to analyze the possibility of creating a solution that can enable NFT transfers in an environment that supports complete anonymity but is still compatible with Ethereum. The proposed infrastructure represents a zero-knowledge mixer supporting shielded transfers of the NFTs on the side chain with the ability to withdraw NFTs back on the main chain.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Many existing solutions utilize zero-knowledge proofs to shield transactions or mix the coins and tokens. Those solutions include Zero cash, Tornado cash, Monero, and many more. The common thread connecting all of them is that they are meant for transferring currency. Although some providers (like Tornadocash [1]) announced, ZK solutions for transferring NFTs are not very popular. Unlike the currency, the NFTs are unique objects, and it is not easy nor practical to hide them in plain sight. It is possible to hide what is transferred, but it is easy to follow the trail if the thing that is transferred is unique.</p>
<p>NFTs are finding their way to the sidechains, as the Ethereum mainnet transactions often become too much overhead for minting or transferring NFTs [2]. ZK rollups like zkSync are also used for transferring and minting the NFTs [3], but the “ZK” part of the rollup doesn’t refer to privacy but compression of the transactions as a scalability solution. Bridges between sidechains and Ethereum allow NFT transfers between the chains [4], enabling cheap transactions on the side chain and final transfer back on the main chain. None of the general-purpose side chains provide shielded NFT transfers. A new solution promising shielded transfers for any assets is Namada [5, 6], Blockchain specifically built for asset privacy. With new updates of Nightfall, Polygon also announces featuring private NFT exchanges [7].</p>
<p>This research investigates the possibilities of using existing, widely adopted, general-purpose side chains to implement shielded NFT transfers. If the projects featuring shielded NFTs are scarce, a good question is if there is a market need for such a solution. The answer to this may not come from the current state of the market but the predictions of future trends. As the NFTs gain even more popularity and move from the hype-regulated market of novelties to more serious use cases, such as access control, certificate issuing, and similar, there is an indication that shielding NFTs of such documents will become a requirement. Such trends are also visible through the projects announcing future updates supporting this domain.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The main goal of this research is to investigate the possibilities of implementing a zero-knowledge mixer for NFTs, using a side chain for shielding transfers resulting in a proposal of a software architecture and algorithms that would support such a system.</p>
<p>It is essential first to analyze the building blocks of similar solutions to be able to come up with a new one. A cross-chain movement of tokens is enabled using cross-chain bridges. The focus here would be on two-way decentralized bridges between two EVM chains. The two-way bridges consist of two smart contracts on each side. The role of smart contracts is locking tokens on one side and releasing or minting tokens on the other side. The contracts communicate by firing events on one side, and validator nodes that listen to those events trigger operations on the other.</p>
<p>There are two types of blockchains regarding the representation of the main currency on the chain - wallet-based and UTXO base. The wallet-based chains represent currency as a gross numerical value stored in the memory fields associated with specific accounts. When the amount <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is transferred from wallet A to wallet B, the values are updated so that wallet A has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> coins less and wallet B has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> coins more in the associated memory field. This logic is familiar to Ethereum users, as Ethereum is a wallet-based blockchain.</p>
<p>The chains based on UTXOs have a different philosophy. The UTXO acronym stands for “Unspent transaction (TX) output,” which may give a clue on the main structure used for representing the coins. Let’s use Bitcoin as a representative of a UTXO-based chain. Each transaction on Bitcoin requires an input amount of coins that should be transferred to the other address. The user might not see it, but the coins are not just numbers updated with each transaction, as the transactions on Bitcoin have a more strict input-output definition. There are no wallets as memory locations linked with the account, but the coins are represented as one or many UTXOs. Users own their UTXOs by having them linked with their public key and transfer them by signing the transactions using the private key associated with the UTXOs. When the user has a UTXO of five coins and wants to transfer three of them, the transaction uses a UTXO of five coins as input. The outputs of the transaction are two new UTXOs. The first one represents the transferred amount with the value three labeled with the recipient’s public key. The other is the remainder, or the unspent amount with the value two, tagged with the sender’s key. If the user has two UTXOs with two coins each and wants to transfer three coins, the user would use both UTXOs as transaction inputs. Again, the output would be two new UTXOs, one with the transferred amount for the recipient, and the other, the unspent part for the sender.</p>
<p>Systems that enable shielded transactions utilize UTXO representation for the shielded tokens even on chains that are not natively UTXO-based, as that representation is more suitable for the use case. In such systems, the UTXO values are hidden from the public and only visible to the recipient with a private key to decrypt it. The workload for computing transaction parameters is now on the sender’s side, as no other participant can see the UTXO value. The sender prepares the transaction’s inputs and outputs and generates a zero-knowledge proof that the transaction is generated correctly with proper values. The proof must confirm that the sender knows the non-encrypted UTXO value and the correct values of the resulting UTXOs after the transfer. Monero uses additional decoy values as fake UTXOs to spoof the actual token transfer and blur the overall chain of transfers [8]. Preventing double-spending is mainly done using nullifiers - values representing “coupons” for spending the UTXO. The UTXO is tied to a nullifier value, and transferring the UTXO requires the user to submit the nullifier linked with the UTXO, marking the UTXO as used. One nullifier can be used only once. When the piece of UTXO is spent, the remainder and the sent part are converted to new UTXOs with their respective nullifiers.</p>
<p>NFTs represent unique objects, so the methods used for hiding and splitting the token batches are not directly applicable to NFTs. Conversely, if the methods could be adapted to support NFTs, most well-tested algorithms and flows could be reused. Converting NFT to a UTXO-like object, called commitments, may be straightforward. The commitment may hide the token address and ID information, but the quantity value will always be one. Unfortunately, even if the quantity and token information are hidden, tracking the token in the network is easy. There is a 1-to-1 mapping between the input token and the resulting commitment. A solution to this problem may lay in decoys.</p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/assets/ERFC-270/decoy.jpeg"></p>
<p>One NFT can be converted to one correct commitment followed by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N-1"> false commitments constructed as decoys. This schema would fail when only the NFT commitment is transferred to the other user, revealing which of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> commitments was the NFT. To mitigate this problem, each transfer transaction of the NFT commitment should also include transferring <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> additional decoys to different addresses. When all participants use decoys with their transfers, the transfer graph is quickly blurred, and finding the actual NFT commitment needle in a haystack of decoys becomes difficult. One downside of this approach is a quicker filling of the commitment Merkle tree, but it can be mitigated using a bigger tree. The other is the cost increase. Under the assumption that the decoying mechanism provides reasonable privacy and anonymity, the protocol can reuse the previous building blocks to complete the system.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="depositing-nfts-from-ethereum-to-the-side-chain">Depositing NFTs from Ethereum to the side chain</h2>
<p>User deposits NFTs on the Ethereum smart contract by sending a transaction allowing the smart contract to take over the NFT. On the side chain, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> commitments are minted and added to a Merkle tree. The smart contract can’t say which commitment resembles the NFT, so the commitment values need to be constructed in a specific way by the user and submitted to Ethereum smart contract. The NFT commitment should be a hash of NFT ID, NFT address, owner’s ephemeral public key, and some secret value. Other, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N-1">, commitments should be hashes of a string value NULL, the owner’s ephemeral public key, and some other secret value. The user must provide ZK proof that exactly one commitment is the NFT commitment while all other <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N-1"> values are decoys. Each commitment is tied to a nullifier, generated as a hash of the commitment ID, a Merkle path of the commitment inside the Merkle tree, and the same secret value used for the specific commitment. The secrets should be different for each commitment-nullifier pair. By doing this setup, the public still doesn’t know which commitment is the NFT, but anyone can verify that one of the commitments indeed is the NFT, while others are blanks.</p>
</section>
<section id="transfering-nfts-on-the-sidechain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transfering-nfts-on-the-sidechain">Transfering NFTs on the sidechain</h2>
<p>Users on the side chain are identified using their new ephemeral keys, meaning the keys should be changed frequently. The keys are the private key, public key, and encryption key. The public key is a private key hash, while the encryption key is “the real” public key, in the sense of public-key cryptography, derived from the private key. Transferring NFTs is similar to tornado cash logic with the addition of decoys. For each NFT transfer, the user also transfers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N-1"> other decoys to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N-1"> different addresses. Received decoys from other users can (and should) be used in further transfers of NFTs, thus enabling further obfuscation of the trading paths. Each transfer on the sidechain is a shielded transfer, meaning that it is not performed as a regular token transfer but as a protocol backed by zero-knowledge proofs. Before explaining the protocol, let us first see how the commitment is constructed. The commitment contains two values, the commitment value, defined during deposit, and a secret value used as a salt while generating the first value. Both values are stacked in a byte array and encrypted using the owner’s public key. When the user wants to transfer the commitment, a new commitment and decoys are sent to the sidechain. ZK proof is also sent on the chain, proving that all the computations were correct. The sender proves that the new commitment is derived from the proper input commitments and nullifiers, and the output commitments are generated in the way that only one output commitment contains the NFT. The new commitment is encrypted using the recipient’s public key, so only the recipient can decrypt it and use it later. The recipient listens to the sidechain events to see if any new commitment can be decrypted using his private key and notes down all the commitments that pass the test.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="withdrawing-nfts-from-the-side-chain-to-ethereum">Withdrawing NFTs from the side chain to Ethereum</h2>
<p>The user who initiates withdrawal must prove ownership of the commitment representing the NFT by providing ZK proof. The user proves the knowledge of the secret preimage used for generating the initial commitment. When the proof is verified and valid, the commitment is nullified. The smart contract on the Ethereum transfers the locked NFT to the Ethereum address provided within the withdrawal request.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>The system’s building blocks are presented in the previous chapter, and it is time to put them all together. The system architecture consists of two smart contracts, one on Ethereum and the other on the EVM side chain, and a validator network that can support the bridge between the chains.</p>
<p>The commitment format is a slightly modified UTXO Tornado Cash implementation used for TORN tokens, which benefits the protocol’s safety, as it is not an entirely new, untested concept. The strength of the protocol lies in indistinguishable commitments that are simultaneously transferred to multiple addresses. An external viewer cannot discern which of the commitments hide the NFT, as with each transfer step, new <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N-1"> commitments are generated or reused and transferred to obfuscate the token trail further. The novelty introduced by the protocol lies in the initial issuing of commitments for NFT as hashes, backed by the zero-knowledge proofs, which guarantee that strictly one copy of the token is cloned on the sidechain while the other copies are decoys. The proposed name for the protocol is “The thimblerig protocol,” as it closely resembles a street con artist who tries to hide a ball by shuffling it many times under multiple, same-looking cups.</p>
<p>The downside of the protocol is the volume of commitments generated for transferring decoys and their respective nullifiers, which are stored locally in wallets. A proof of concept implementation is needed to estimate better the protocol cost, efficiency, and practical usability.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The presented protocol represents a combination of the existing protocols for shielded transfers and token mixing, adapted for NFT transfers. Generic in nature, it can be used between any two EVM chains. The next steps should include selecting the practical use cases that require the shielded NFT token transfers and evaluating the usability of the presented protocol against the selected use cases. Further research may also require a proof of concept implementation between two designated EVM chains.</p>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Smart Contracts</strong> are applications built on blockchain that, once deployed, cannot be altered or updated. With that in mind, their testing is crucial, even more so than in traditional software development.</p>
<p>Several different techniques exist in the testing of Smart Contracts, and it is up to the developers to choose when a technique should be used with the goal of creating tests that will perform sufficient validation. This is a non-standardized, individualistic approach as there is no established methodology for doing this, and the developers’ skill plays an essential part in it.</p>
<p>This research focuses on testing techniques that are most widely used and showcases them in order to give a sense of what kind of testing is possible and where it makes sense.</p>
<p>In testing, there is always the question of whether the collection of tests (test suite) covers all of the cases - “Who will guard the guards themselves?”*.</p>
<p>To answer this question, to a certain degree, the paper elaborates on evaluation tools that indicate whether or not more tests should be written or if there’s a case that is overlooked.</p>
<p>As the techniques and tools mature and increase in complexity, we may see the introduction of standardized methodologies that provide a thinking framework on how code should be written and/or tested, as well as a separation of roles between developers and testers.</p>
<p>*Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? - a Latin phrase found in the work of the Roman poet Juvenal (Satire VI, lines 347–348)</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Testing involves thinking about how code sections should behave in the wanted (ideal) case, but also what consequences might occur if some unintended actions are performed by unaware or even malevolent actors.</p>
<p>The logical question occurs of “what needs to get tested … and how ?”. This is an extremely hard question, and the answer to it lies in the considerations that the developers consciously/unconsciously make. It is important that they keep up to date with the latest techniques, now more than ever, as the past experiences of others can help in establishing best practices and be used in solving similar or completely new problems.</p>
<p>Sanity checks can be performed by using evaluation tools that help with casting light on areas that were previously overlooked. Still, to add another layer of confidence, a set of completely new, trusted eyes should separately go through the code and try to find bugs and/or exploits in it. This is referred to as a Smart Contract audit and is the last step before the deployment to mainnet.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The focus of this research is on the testing and evaluation techniques that are currently being used in the area of Smart Contract development in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem without going down the rabbit hole of what the best practices are.</p>
<p>The methodology consists of describing a technique and then giving an appropriate example that shows when it is adequate to use it. Frameworks are purposefully not mentioned, as it is more important to first understand the key concepts of what is being done rather than the unique and specific details of how something is done.</p>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">

<p>As to not give too abstract and vague descriptions, an example of a smart contract is given on which the testing can be performed and through which a better understanding can be created.</p>

<section id="unit-testing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h3>
<p>Unit Testing relies on keeping the tests separate from each other and as simple as possible, with each unit test being responsible for testing a single module(“unit”).</p>
<p>These tests follow a common pattern referred to as <strong>Arrange-Act-Assert(AAA)</strong>. First, the “arrangments” are made to put the system in the desired state, then the “act” is performed (function call most often) that leads the system to the next state, after which that state is “asserted” for correctness.</p>
<p>In an individual unit test, most often, only one assertion is made, which increases the number of tests. This, however, has the benefits of having a clear indication of why a test has failed and increasing the code readability.</p>
<p>When thinking about unit testing the <code>DummyToken</code> contract, we will take only the <code>transfer</code> function as an example. Following is an incomplete list of test scenarios for this functionality that should serve as a starting point.</p>
<section id="test-scenarios" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-scenarios">Test Scenarios:</h4>
<p>To form a part of a test suite, let us divide the test scenarios into two sections (<strong>generalized</strong> and <strong>edge cases</strong>) and write some examples of tests for each of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Generalized:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Valid* Transfer <code>amount</code>** of <code>DummyToken</code> from <code>address0</code> to <code>address1</code> where <code>address0</code> != <code>address1</code>
<ul>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li><code>address0</code>’s balance is decremented by the <code>amount</code></li>
<li><code>address1</code>’s balance is incremented by the <code>amount</code></li>
<li>balances of other adresses has not changed</li>
<li><code>Transfer</code> event was emitted with the corresponding fields</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Invalid* Transfer <code>amount</code> of <code>DummyToken</code> from <code>address0</code> to <code>address1</code> where <code>address0</code> != <code>address1</code>
<ul>
<li>Tests:
<ul>
<li>transaction was reverted with the right message (“Transfer amount exceeds balance”)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Edge Cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Valid/Invalid Transfer <code>amount</code> of <code>DummyToken</code> from <code>address0</code> to <code>address1</code> where <code>address0</code> == <code>address1</code></li>
<li>Valid Transfer <code>0/1</code> of <code>DummyToken</code> from <code>address0</code> to <code>address1</code> where <code>address0</code> != <code>address1</code></li>
<li>Valid Transfer <code>0/1</code> of <code>DummyToken</code> from <code>address0</code> to <code>address1</code> where <code>address0</code> == <code>address1</code></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>*Term “Valid/Invalid” refers to the fact of whether this transfer should be possible (due to balance amounts).</p>
<p>**<code>amount</code> can be any <code>uint</code> (including the value being greater than the total supply)</p>
<p>We can notice that for the first scenario of the generalized section, four tests need to be written, with each of them being a unit test that checks a specific thing (i.e., the sender’s balance has been decremented by the right amount).</p>
<p>It is important to note that a “Property-based Testing” technique was used in the above list, which is a form of an automated process called “fuzzing” that is used to find bugs by feeding randomized data into the system. This technique focuses on the “properties” of the code that should always hold. The tests are not concerned with the actual values of <code>amount</code>, <code>address0</code>, and <code>address1</code>, which can be anything in the allowed range of possibilities. Rather, they aim to say whether the properties around the balances hold in the test scenario - i.e., if an account transfers some tokens to another account, only those two balances should be affected.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="integration-testing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="integration-testing">Integration Testing</h3>
<p>In the context of Smart Contract testing, integration tests validate interactions between different components of a single contract or across multiple different contracts and are more complex when compared to unit tests.</p>
<p>One form of integration testing is <strong>Stateful testing</strong>, an advanced method of property-based testing, where a single test is defined by:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>initial state</strong> that can, after deployment, be kept as it is or be created by some fixed sequence of <strong>actions</strong></li>
<li><strong>actions</strong> - transactions that lead to a transition of state</li>
<li><strong>invariants</strong> which are properties that should always hold true</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting from the <strong>initial state</strong>, a randomized sequence of <strong>actions</strong> is carried out, where after each action, all of the <strong>invariants</strong> are tested.</p>
<p>For example, when writing a “stateful” test for the <code>DummyToken</code> contract :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>initial state</strong> can be created such that each test account calls a <code>deposit</code> function with a random amount of Ether provided</li>
<li><strong>actions</strong> can be kept basic (<code>deposit</code> , <code>transfer</code> and <code>withdraw</code>) or more complex (nested - i.e.&nbsp;one action can be [<code>deposit</code>, <code>withdraw</code>, <code>withdraw</code>,…])</li>
<li>one of the <strong>invariants</strong> can be that sum of account balances of the <code>DummyToken</code> must always be equal to the Ether amount that the contract holds</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides being more complex, integration tests require more resources and execution time.</p>
</section>
<section id="static-code-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="static-code-analysis">Static (code) analysis</h3>
<p>Both of the above-mentioned forms of testing are considered a type of “dynamic code analysis” that searches for bugs during the execution of the program, and they are the main topic of this research.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning its counterpart - <strong>Static code analysis</strong> or just <strong>Static analysis</strong>, which is a debugging method that examines the source code before a program is run. This is done by analyzing the code against a set of detection rules that include: timestamp dependency, integer underflow/overflow, re-entrancy issues, use of tx.origin instead of msg.sender, … It remains up to the developer to implement or reject the recommendations of these rules.</p>
</section>
<section id="general-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-considerations">General Considerations</h3>
<p>Smart Contracts operate in an extremely hostile environment, and this should always be taken into account. During development and testing, the most valuable guiding principle is that everything that can go wrong will eventually go wrong, especially if someone stands to benefit from it.</p>
<p>A set of principles can be adopted to make the functionality of a contract and its complexity more manageable as to reduce the probability of bugs or exploits happening. Some of those include that:</p>
<ul>
<li>code should be modularized and kept simple (KISS and DRY principles*** should be followed)</li>
<li>clarity should be preferred over performance (if possible)</li>
<li>latest versions of battle-tested tools and frameworks should be used</li>
<li>the blockchain characteristics should be considered</li>
<li>the latest security developments should always be incorporated</li>
<li>deployment and testing should be done on Testnet before moving to Mainnet</li>
</ul>
<p>*** KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) are software programming principles where KISS states that the most simple solutions often work the best, while DRY follows the reasoning that same/similar code sections should not be replicated across the code base.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="evaluation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>The purpose of tests is to verify the correctness of the implementation, which poses the question of whether or not the test suite is sufficient for the implementation requirements. To address this and to have a sanity check for a developer’s thought process, evaluation tools have been created.</p>
<section id="code-coverage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-coverage">Code Coverage</h3>
<p>The term <strong>code coverage</strong> refers to the set of evaluation metrics that are used to determine how much of the program has been tested by the test suite - how many functions have been called, how many statements have been executed, etc.</p>
<p>For example, in the code below, to reach a 100% coverage for the function <code>fcn</code>, at least one of the tests would need to call with parameters that pass all of the three <code>if</code> statements (i.e.&nbsp;<code>fcn(32, 300, 500)</code>).</p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>function fcn (uint a, uint b, uint c) {

    if(a &lt; 100) {
        if(b &gt; 200) {
            if(c &gt; 300 &amp;&amp; c &lt; 600) {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>While a high coverage doesn’t generally equal good tests, low coverage helps in identifying gaps in the test suite that can be filled by adding new, carefully designed tests.</p>
<section id="coverage-guided-fuzzing" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coverage-guided-fuzzing">Coverage-guided Fuzzing</h4>
<p>During testing, feeding purely randomized values is often wasteful and time-consuming. In the example above, parameter <code>a</code> is of type <code>uint</code>, which means it can hold any value in the range [0, 2**64-1], but the condition <code>a &lt; 100</code> will hold true only for a small portion of time.</p>
<p>Coverage-guided Fuzzing takes into account code coverage information for each random value it tries, and if that value executes a new code, it is put in the set of promising values. For example, if <code>a = 32</code> has been generated, fuzzer will keep note of it, as it opens the door to new code - it can then keep <code>a</code> fixed and randomize parameters <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, thus reducing the search space.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="mutation-testing-mutation-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mutation-testing-mutation-analysis">Mutation Testing (Mutation analysis)</h3>
<p>Mutation testing is a technique used to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing minor modifications, called “mutations”, in the code, thus producing “mutants”.</p>
<p>These modifications are performed using a fixed set of mutation operators like operand replacement, expression modification, statement modification, etc.</p>
<p>Listed below is an example of an <strong>original</strong> code as well as one potential <strong>mutant</strong> that can be generated from it.</p>
<p><strong>Original Code</strong></p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>function fcn (uint a, uint b) returns (bool) {

    if(a &gt; b){

        return true;
    }

    return false;
}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Mutant #1</strong> - produced by using an expression modification operator (replaced <code>&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;</code>)</p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>function fcn (uint a, uint b) returns (bool) {

    if(a &lt; b){

        return true;
    }

    return false;
}</code></pre>
<p>These mutants are then tested, and, ideally, all of them would need to get caught (killed) by at least one of the tests. The percentage of killed mutants is referred to as the <strong>mutation score</strong>.</p>
<p>These techniques can give insight into what are the tests missing and where are the blind spots as well as what tests are rarely killing mutants - both of which is valuable when improving the test suite.</p>
<p>If a mutant cannot be compiled (i.e., mutation produced a syntax error), it is called <strong>stillborn</strong> and is not taken into consideration. Sometimes, mutants can have the same behavior as the original code, in which case, they are referred to as <strong>equivalent mutants</strong>. These mutants will not get killed by the test suite and will lower the mutation score. Detecting and taking them out of consideration is not an easy task and is the biggest obstacle to the widespread application of mutation testing.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This research concludes that the space of testing techniques is vast and evolving. As the complexity of challenges that the developers are faced with is rapidly increasing, staying up to date is a task by itself.</p>
<p>With time, we will probably see more and more specialized roles and the separation of responsibilities as it was done in traditional software. For this to happen, some standards should be formed that would enable effective communication between team members, namely clear requirement specification documents.</p>
<p>While posing a risk of the field becoming too rigid, rather than each individual/team having a different approach, we may also see the evolution of techniques and frameworks leading up to complete standardized methodologies.</p>
<p>Some possible roads for future research on this topic should include tools that are used when creating a well-documented functional specification for the project and digging deeper into the evaluation methods, specifically mutation testing, which is an active area of research.</p>

  <title>SBT - Soulbound Tokens</title>
  <dc:creator>Aleksandar Damjanovic</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This paper explores the SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) as a concept, their potential use cases, and the difficulties of implementing this solution. It also covers concepts of social and community recovery and briefly covers designated-verifier proofs and verifiable delay functions as they are potential enablers of this solution.</p>
<p>SBTs as a concept have major potential, although they face major obstacles like legacy systems, privacy and cold start issues. Nevertheless there is a positive sentiment towards this solution.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The online identity of users plays an essential role in Web2. It allows users to have an online reputation, a unique identifier, and access to products and services that would otherwise not be available to them.</p>
<p>In the Web3 ecosystem, there is a persistent problem of proving the identity and personhood of a user without going through various KYC processes. There have been multiple attempts to aggregate identities in a decentralized way, and solutions like Litentry, Open Rights Exchange and IDX have emerged as solutions to this problem. However, there is no standard for creating unique Web3 user identities. These identities, in theory, could broaden the use-cases and the complexity of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>In 2021 and the beginning of 2022, NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) were the “hot topic”. Some of those NFTs reached a sale price of over $90.000.000.<sup>1</sup> At the core of these tokens is their transferability between addresses (parties), be it transfers or sales. Alas, we will not cover NFTs in great detail as there are more papers and research on that topic.</p>
<p>In this paper, we explore the newly proposed primitive: SBTs (Soulbound Tokens), which trade in transferability to satisfy other potential use cases that could not be satisfied with transferable NFTs. The “soulbound” in the name of SBTs takes inspiration from the famous game World of Warcraft, where some items, once acquired, are bound to the player and cannot be traded or transferred.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The goal is to understand the need for this type of tokens, the necessity of using them for various use-cases in Web3, and the utility they could provide.</p>
<p>This will be done by exploring the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">“Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul”</a> paper written by E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, and Vitalik Buterin and how non-transferable SBTs could transform the Web3 space(lending, governance, reputation, etc.). Current sentiment towards this new primitive will also be explored (social media, blog posts, papers, etc.).</p>
<p>This research can be used as a short overview of the paper mentioned above and an overview of the current sentiment on SBTs.</p>

<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<section id="some-of-the-current-problems-in-web3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-of-the-current-problems-in-web3">Some of the current problems in Web3</h2>
<p>If we look at the Web2 as it is now, the online identities of various users are a major part of various processes. Users can even use their identity on other platforms to easily register to others with a click or two. For example, a Google account In the future, unique identity linked to a user (in this case a “Soul”) could be a solution that would bring onboard more people to Web3, unlock new potential uses-cases, and potentially create a standardized reputation system. Currently Web3 is dependent on various Web2 structures regarding representing social identity. Examples:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>NFT platforms rely on centralized platforms for a proof of scarcity and initial provenance.</li>
<li>DAOs. If DAOS want to prevent Sybil attacks, they usually rely on social media profiles for proof of personhood.</li>
<li>Web3 participants rely on centralized custodial wallets. Wallets that offer decentralized key management are not user-friendly.</li>
<li>Generally, it’s hard to establish reputation systems and manage blacklisting as anyone can create another address and access your protocol, for example</li>
<li>Lack of native web3 identity. This makes undercollateralized lending virtually impossible.</li>
<li>Governance vulnerability to financial attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>These problems could, in theory, as the paper mentioned earlier says, be solved by introducing SBTs in Web3.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-souls-exactly" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-souls-exactly">What are souls exactly?</h2>
<p><strong>Souls are accounts or wallets that hold publicly visible, non-transferable tokens. Those tokens could pottentially also be revocable by the issuer.</strong><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The tokens that the Soul account or wallet owns should be SBTs. Soul could, in theory, hold various types of tokens, but that possibility isn’t explored in the paper. SBTs could be used to represent affiliations, credentials, memberships, etc. but more on that in the following paragraphs. The true power of these tokens lies if there was a possibility for SBTs to be issued and verified by other Soul accounts that are counterparties in the relationship. These counterparty Souls could be individuals, companies, or institutions.</p>
<p>Another essential property of Soul accounts or wallets is the abundance of a requirement for a soul to be linked to a legal name or a need to ensure that there is one soul account per human. Soul accounts or wallets could also be possibly transferred across humans.</p>
<p>Souls can also be a type of reputation signal of the user to the ecosystem. Depending on the SBTs that the soul account has, the user could have a positive or negative reputation. A positive reputation could give the user various benefits regarding products and services, and a negative one could prevent users from accessing them. This property can also pose a problem protocols could “redline” (discriminate) owners of some SBTs and prevent them from using their product.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="possible-use-cases-of-sbts">Possible use cases of SBTs</h2>
<section id="sbts-and-lending" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sbts-and-lending">SBTs and Lending</h3>
<p>In traditional finance, reputation is a significant factor in uncollateralized lending. This system often relies on centralized credit scores of borrowers to gauge creditworthiness. However, this has flaws like not providing lending services if there is insufficient data on the borrower and discrimination.</p>
<p>In Web3, users must overcollateralize in the token of their choice to receive a loan. This is where the SBTs could, in theory, provide a solution.</p>
<p><strong>“Implementation and adoption of SBTs have a potential to unlock a censorship-resistant, bottom-up alternative to top-down commercial and”social” credit systems.”</strong> - E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin</p>
<p>In the case of lending, SBTs could represent education credentials, work history, and rental contracts, which could signal “creditworthiness”.</p>
<p>The loans themselves could be represented by the SBTs, which could be burnable by the institution that has given the loan. After the burning of the token, an institution could send another SBT to the borrower. This time it would be a proof of timely repayment SBT. This token could serve as a “signal” to other lenders that this borrower returns his/hers loans on time, which would impact the borrower’s “credit score” and provide the borrower with better loan conditions. Non-transferability prevents transferring or hiding outstanding loans. A rich ecosystem of SBTs ensures that borrowers who try to escape their loans (creating a new soul) will have insufficient SBTs to stake their reputation.</p>
<section id="community-lending-market" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="community-lending-market">Community lending market</h4>
<p><strong>“SBTs would offer a substrate for community lending practices similar to those pioneered by Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, where members of a social network agree to support one another’s liabilities. Because a Soul’s constellation of SBTs represents memberships across social groups, participants could easily discover other Souls who would be valuable co-participants in a group lending project.Whereas commercial lending is a”lend-it-and-forget-it” until repayment model, community lending might take a “lend-it-and-help-it” approach—combining working capital with human capital with greater rates of return.”</strong> - E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-the-first-steps" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-first-steps">What are the first steps?</h4>
<p>There are a couple of “requirements” for this type of lending to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soul accounts/wallets would carry SBTs they are comfortable sharing publicly. This could be an excellent first step for the adoption of social/intra-community lending in Web3.</li>
<li>Social relationships and credentials would play a significant role in this type of lending.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="sbts-and-nfts" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sbts-and-nfts">SBTs and NFTs</h3>
<p>In terms of NFTs , Souls could play a major role in terms of artist’s reputation. When issuing NFTs artist could issue them from their Soul.</p>
<p>“The more SBTs the artist’s Soul carries, the easier it would be for buyers to identify the Soul as belonging to that artist, and thereby also confirm the NFT’s legitimacy. Artists could go a step further to issue a linked SBT stored in their Soul that attests to the NFT’s membership to a”collection” and vouches for whatever scarcity limits the artist wishes to set. Souls would thus create a verifable, on-chain way to stake and build reputation on the provenance and scarcity of an object.” - E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin</p>
<p>The application of SBTs in this market extends beyond art. Some examples of potential use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>various services</li>
<li>rentals/property</li>
<li>authentication</li>
<li>social provenance</li>
<li>retail</li>
<li>gaming</li>
<li>and many more, SBTs unlock the use cases where NFTs cannot be applicable</li>
</ul>

<section id="soul-accounts-in-airdrops-and-daos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="soul-accounts-in-airdrops-and-daos">Soul Accounts in Airdrops and DAOs</h3>
<p>Soulbound Tokens could also enable communities to be convened at the intersection of souls and to form a DAO, for example. Drops of SBTs or “Souldrops” can be given based on SBTs and other tokens within a Soul (soul account/wallet). Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>conference attendees</li>
<li>certified programmers</li>
<li>early members</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>“Souldrops could also introduce novel incentives to encourage community engagement. Dropped SBTs could be engineered to be soulbound for a period but eventually”vest” into transferable tokens over time. Or the reverse could be true. Transferable tokens held for some period could unlock the right to SBTs that confer further governance rights over a protocol. SBTs open a rich possibility space to experiment with mechanisms that maximize community engagement and other goals, like decentralization” - E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin</p>
<p>In DAOS, SBTs could be used to mitigate Sybil attacks in various ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>computing over a Soul’s constellation of SBTs to differentiate between unique Souls and probable bots and denying any voting power to a Soul that appears to be a Sybil.</li>
<li>conferring more voting power to Souls with more reputable SBTs — like work or educational credentials, licenses, or certifications.</li>
<li>issuing specialized “proof-of-personhood” SBTs could help other DAOs bootstrap Sybil resistance.</li>
<li>checking for correlations between SBTs held by Souls who support a particular vote and applying a lower vote weight to highly correlated voters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Souls and SBTs could also be used to estimate the decentralization degree in the governance of DAOs and protocols.</p>
</section>
<section id="property" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="property">Property</h3>
<p>So far, NFTs could not effectively be applied to property rights, considering their ease of transfer. Using SBTs, owners could set different rights and limitations for the same property (vehicles, real estate, events, etc.).</p>

<section id="recovery-of-soul-accountswallets" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recovery-of-soul-accountswallets">Recovery of Soul Accounts/Wallets</h2>
<p>Soul accounts would probably be recoverable by using Social Recovery.</p>
<section id="social-recovery" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="social-recovery">Social recovery</h3>
<p>A social recovery system/wallet works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a single “signing key” that can be used to approve transactions</li>
<li>There is a set of at least 3 (or a much higher number) of “guardians”, of which a majority can cooperate to change the signing key of the account. The signing key can add or remove guardians, though only after a delay.</li>
</ul>
<p>A social recovery wallet can be used as a regular wallet. In case of losing a key, the user can reach out to their guardians and ask them to sign a particular transaction to change the signing pubkey registered in the wallet contract to a new one.</p>
<p>Guardians can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>other devices</li>
<li>friends and family members</li>
<li>institutions (they can verify your identity by phone number, e-mail, etc.)<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sbt-community-recovery" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sbt-community-recovery">SBT community recovery</h3>
<p>In this proposed solution, Soul recovery is tied to the Soul’s memberships across communities.</p>
<p>“In a community recovery model, recovering a Soul’s private keys would require a member from a qualified majority of a (random subset of) Soul’s communities to consent.” - E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin.</p>
<p>This recovery implies secure, off-chain communication channels where authentication can occur.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><em>Picture 1: Social recovery vs SBT community recovery</em></p>
<p><strong>By embedding security in sociality , a Soul can always regenerate their keys through community recovery, which deters Soul theft (or sale): because a Seller would need to prove selling the recovery relationships, any attempt to sell a Soul lacks credibility.</strong> - E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin.</p>
<p>This recovery solution is just a proposition and requires more experimentation.</p>

<section id="implementation-and-adoption-challenges" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation-and-adoption-challenges">Implementation and adoption challenges</h2>
<section id="privacy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in the adoption of SBTs is privacy. Too many public SBTs that a soul possesses can reveal too much information about a soul.</p>
<p>Blockchain systems are public by default, and every transaction and relationship recorded on-chain is available for everyone in the world to see. One possible solution is to have separate souls for professional and private life. These souls can easily be linked if there are no serious privacy solutions.</p>
<p>Another solution is to have SBTs that could store data off-chain, leaving only the hash of the data on-chain.</p>

<p><em>Picture 2: A way to keep some of the SBTs private</em></p>
<p>The choice of how to store data is left to the person. Possible solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>their own devices</li>
<li>a trusted cloud service</li>
<li>IPFS or other decentralized networks</li>
</ul>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are another possible solution that could help kickstart the adoption of SBTs. They also can allow people to prove arbitrary statements without revealing any more information beyond the statement itself. They can be computed over SBTs to prove characteristics about a Soul. Privacy could be extended further by introducing multi-party computation techniques like <a href="https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/blog/introduction-to-garbled-circuit/">garbled circuits</a>.</p>
<p>Other possible solutions for privacy problems include designated-verifier proofs and verifiable delay functions.</p>
<p>For example: If user A wants to prove some property about its SBTs to user B, they can make a zero-knowledge proof of the statement “I hold SBTs that have the property Z.” User B can then be sure as he didn’t make the proof. But what about passing somebody else’s proof? Users can mitigate this by using <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf">verifiable delay functions</a>. Using verifiable delay functions, user A can make and present a proof that can only be made with required SBTs at the moment, but anyone else will be able to make five minutes from now.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bribing-the-owners-of-the-sbts">Bribing the owners of the SBTs</h3>
<p>Owners of the SBTs could be bribed by various parties in order to influence their voting or to exploit their other SBTs.</p>
<p>In the research paper, writers mention these ways of exploits mitigations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“The ecosystem of SBTs could bootstrap of”thick” community channels , where SBTs signal authentic off-chain community membership with strong social bonds and repeat interactions. This would make it easier for communities to alter and revoke SBTs of impersonators and bots. Such thick channels—which we often and in churches, workplaces, schools, meet-up groups, and organizations in civil society—would provide a more sybil-resistant social substrate to police gaming (e.g., through bots, bribes, impersonation) in more “thin” social channels.</li>
<li>Nested communities could require SBTs to force context on potential collusion vectors “just below” them . For example, if a state were holding a funding round or vote, the state might require every participating citizen to also hold an SBT of a defined county and municipality.</li>
<li>The openness and cryptographic provability of the SBT ecosystem could itself be used to actively detect collusive patterns and penalize inauthentic behavior —perhaps discounting the voting power of collusive Souls, or obliging Souls to accept SBTs representing negative attestations.</li>
<li>ZK technology (eg. MACI ) could cryptographically prevent some attestations made by a Soul from being provable.</li>
<li>Encouraging of whistleblowers</li>
<li>Mechanisms from peer-prediction theory</li>
<li>Correlation scores that focus on correlations where there is a large incentive to be honest if a group of Souls share a common interest.” - E.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legacy-systems">Legacy systems</h3>
<p>Current identity systems tend to concentrate power on the issuer of identity proofs. If we look at the government IDs, for example, the user doesn’t own their identity. Government can track users’ movement (passports), revoke licenses (driving licenses), and put an “expiration date” on your ID card. In Web3 idendity is often handled by identity protocols like: Litentry, ORE network and IDX. When it comes to identity, SBTs and their DeSoc property could, in theory, replace the existing legacy system. However, changes in ID systems usually take a very long time.</p>
</section>
<section id="cold-start-challenge" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cold-start-challenge">Cold start challenge</h3>
<p>The research paper asks a question: <strong>What comes first SBTs or social recovery?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to SBTs currently revokable tokens could be created and minted to wallets. They are referred to as “Proto SBTs”, allthough they are not as practical as SBTs proposed they could be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Community recovery wallets like <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/">Argent</a> and <a href="https://loopring.io/#/">Loopring</a> also show that social recovery wallets can work in practice.</p>

<p><em>Picture 3: Social recovery wallets explained</em></p>
<p>“Norms can also shepherd Souls into existence. As we rethink tokens and wallets, we can also reframe how we think about certain classes of NFTs and tokens that are intended to signal membership. In particular, we can introduce a norm of not transferring NFTs and POAPs issued by reputable institutions that reflect attendance to a conference, work experience, or education credentials. Such transfers of membership tokens—if traded for value—could diminish the reputation of a wallet and perhaps discourage issuers from further issuing membership or POAP tokens to that wallet.” - E.

<p>When the paper came out on May 11th 2022, it didn’t gain mainstream attention initially. Around 20th of May the paper and the ideas in it caught the attention of media outside Web3 space with magazines like <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/05/26/what-are-soulbound-tokens-web3-buterin/">Fortune</a> covering the ideas presented.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/iamjasonlevin/status/1527316024659353601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1527316024659353601%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnftnow.com%2Fguides%2Fsoulbound-tokens-sbts-meet-the-tokens-that-may-change-your-life%2F">In an interview</a> held by Jason Levin with E. Glen Weyl , the author predicted that that SBTs will be available for early uses by the end of 2022 and that the 2024 up cycle will focus on SBTs.</p>
<p>Overall response to the paper was very positive all across the board and many potential use cases are discussed.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>As presented above, Souls and SBTs and their potential implementation have many obstacles in front of them. Problems like privacy, bribing users, and cold-start challenges are not the small ones to get a grip on. Souls and community recovery system would also require efficient and secure off-chain communication channels.</p>
<p>When it comes to privacy, zero-knowledge proofs are a great possible solution to this problem. Other problems presented will be hard to solve.</p>
<p>Regarding Web3 and its mass adoption and its principles, SBTs (Soulbound tokens) seem like the next logical step. There are various potential use-cases for them, and if the initial hurdles presented in this research and the research paper of the authors are to be overcome, it is more than likely that SBTs will start a “new chapter” in Web3 and onboard new users.</p>
<p>If the potential use-cases are satisfied, SBTs have the potential to change society as we know it. All beginnings are rough, right?</p>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This research examines the possibility of hardcoding the royalty logic for the NFT royalty payments. It also explores how are royalties for NFT creators/artists taken care of by two largest NFT marketplaces OpenSea and LooksRare. It examines the EIP-2981 which aims to solve the royalty implementation problem. Small experiment is conducted with a goal to modify the transfer function from the ERC-721 standard.</p>
<p>After explorative research and a short experiment we have come to these conclusions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Marketplaces prefer handling the royalties themselves and only for the trades on their platform</li>
<li>ERC-2981 contains the optional royalty implementation logic. It’s on the platforms to decide whether they will utilize this standard.</li>
<li>Hardcoding royalties without making “a mess” of the NFT smart-contract is currently way too complex and would require altering the ERC-721 heavily.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Current markketplaces and NFTs have fragmented royalty payment implementations. This leaves the nft artist/creator with the issue of unpredictable royalty payments for his art. Each marketplace has different solutions for this problem. EIP-2981 has basic royalty implementation. Which doesn’t enforce actual payments. Royalty Contract Standardization (RCS) could in theory be done by modifying the transfer functions to enable the transfer of royalties to the creator during trading of the NFT via transaction splitting.</p>
<p><strong>This research is the aftermath of a brainstorming session and has some brave assumptions initially, which is why this short research is conducted to further validate those assumptions.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The goal of this research is to explore how royalties are taken care of currently and the way EIP-2981 works and the possibility of further improvement.</p>
<p>This will done by doing an explorative research of current royalty implementations on OpenSea and LooksRare as they are the biggest players.</p>
<p>Another examination will be done, maimly of the EIP-2981 standard to explore the solution it proposes.</p>
<p>Afterwards we will examine the possibility of hardcoding royalty in the NFT contract itself.</p>

<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<section id="opensea" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opensea">OpenSea</h2>
<p>OpenSea offers royalties for Artists and Creator which are usually around 10%. They are also applied to secondary sales and the proceeds after fees go to the seller of the NFT.</p>
<p>Users can check the royalty fees with 3 methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Attempting to buy an NFT which will then open up a checkout window where the royalty amount is listed under the name of the NFT.</li>
<li>Installing the Flava Chrome extension which shows the royalty next to the NFT without needing to open the checkout menu.</li>
<li>Using the NFT analytics tools - There are numerous NFT analytics tools that include creator royalties in their stats.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see royalties are very important part of NFT space and they are of great importance for both traders and creators.</p>
<section id="how-do-creators-earn-their-royaties" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-creators-earn-their-royaties">How do creators earn their royaties</h3>
<p>On OpenSea proceeds from the primary sales of the NFT are immediately forwarded to the creators address. Royalties are usually held by OpenSea for 2-4 weeks before paid out to the creator, this includes <strong>both primary sales and secondary sales</strong>.</p>
<p>Royalties are not automatically set on OpenSea and the creator of the collection must set the royalty percentage and the payout address on the collection level.</p>
</section>
<section id="opensea-royalty-on-other-marketplaces" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opensea-royalty-on-other-marketplaces">OpenSea royalty on other marketplaces</h3>
<p>OpenSea royalties are enforced on many other platforms. This is a result of various legal agreements between platforms.</p>
<p>If we are talking about ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standard tokens there is no royalty support on token or smart contract level. That is why previosly mentioned legal agreements are needed to enforce royalty payments.<sup>2</sup></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="looksrare" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looksrare">LooksRare</h2>
<p>LooksRare is a decentralized NFT marketplace which rewards traders, token stakers, creators and collectors for participating on the platform.</p>
<p>It was launched in January 22 with an aim to dethrone Opensea from it’s spot as a leader in the NFT market.</p>
<p>As a community-first platform all the revenue generated is distributed to the stakers of LOOKS token.</p>
<section id="token" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="token">Token</h3>
<p>LOOKS is the native token that powers the LooksRare marketplace, its price is $0.5908 at the time of this writing. It is used for staking and various rewards.</p>
</section>
<section id="royalties" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="royalties">Royalties</h3>
<p>Whenever the NFT is traded on LooksRare there are 2 types of fee the seller is charged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform fee (2%)</li>
<li>Creator royalties</li>
</ul>
<p>“Creator royalties are fees that are decided by the collection creator. Collection owners can specify a percentage of royalties they wish to recieve on their collection management page.”</p>
<p>Royalties are on-chain. Whenever a sale is made through the platform the royalties are paid in the same transaction as the sale and the creators instantly recieve their royalty. This is one of the ways LooksRare is different from OpenSea.</p>
<p>LooksRare also supports EIP-2981 royalty standard which takes precedent over any royalties specified directly on LooksRare.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="eip-2981" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="eip-2981">EIP-2981</h2>
<p>This standard provides a way to retrieve royalty payment information for NFTs with a goal to enable universal support for royalty payments across all NFT marketplaces and ecosystem participants.</p>
<p>This standard enables all marketplaces to retrieve royalty payment information for a given NFT. This enables accurate royalty payments regardless of which marketplace the NFT is sold or re-sold at.</p>
<p>This standard only provides a mechanism to fetch the royalty amount and recipients. The actual funds transfer is something the marketplace needs to do.</p>
<p>“Royalty amounts are always a percentage of the sale price. If a marketplace chooses not to implement this EIP, then no funds will be paid for secondary sales.”</p>
<p><strong>That is one of the reasons hardcoding royalties idea was proposed.</strong></p>
<p>EIP-2981 can also be integrated with other contracts to return royalty payment information. <strong>ERC-2981</strong> is a royalty standard for many asset types.</p>
<p>It is recomended to read the full specification of the proposal in order to better understand the issue at hand and the way it is handled in the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981">EIP-2981</a>.</p>
<p>In the proposal the writers have come to these conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“It is impossible to know which NFT transfers are the result of sales, and which are merely wallets moving or consolidating their NFTs. Therefore, we cannot force every transfer function, such as transferFrom() in ERC-721, to involve a royalty payment as not every transfer is a sale that would require such payment.”</p></li>
<li><p>“It is impossible to fully know and efficiently implement all possible types of royalty payments logic. With that said, it is on the royalty payment receiver to implement all additional complexity and logic for fee splitting, multiple receivers, taxes, accounting, etc. in their own receiving contract or off-chain processes. Attempting to do this as part of this standard, it would dramatically increase the implementation complexity, increase gas costs, and could not possibly cover every potential use-case.”</p></li>
<li><p>“This EIP mandates a percentage-based royalty fee model. It is likely that the most common case of percentage calculation will be where the royaltyAmount is always calculated from the _salePrice using a fixed percent i.e.&nbsp;if the royalty fee is 10%, then a 10% royalty fee must apply whether _salePrice is 10, 10000 or 1234567890.”</p></li>
<li><p>“This EIP does not specify a currency or token used for sales and royalty payments. The same percentage-based royalty fee must be paid regardless of what currency, or token was used in the sale, paid in the same currency or token. This applies to sales in any location including on-chain sales, over-the-counter (OTC) sales, and off-chain sales using fiat currency such as at auction houses. As royalty payments are voluntary, entities that respect this EIP must pay no matter where the sale occurred - a sale outside of the blockchain is still a sale.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>They also plan on taking on the mechanism for paying and notifying the recepient in the future EIPs.<sup>3</sup></p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p><strong>Data Analytics</strong> is the science of analyzing raw data related to a specific problem and extracting all of the necessary information in order to make conclusions about as well as derive approaches for solving it.</p>
<p>In the context of <strong>Blockchain</strong>, Data Analytics revolves around the process of collecting and parsing of raw transaction data thus transforming it into usable and actionable data. Parsing of those transactions requires knowledge about the chain specifics as well as internal workings of Smart Contract that that are of interest which is an extremely time consuming process - all of the data on the Blockchain, while it may be public and unchangable, is unstructured.</p>
<p>Blockchain data, however, holds all of the chain’s history since its inception, making it possible to see past interactions between addresses and/or Smart Contracts. This data can then be segmented to include only a wanted subset for which the analysis will be performed. With this aggregated information it is then possible to gain insight in the past trends for a set of Non-Fungible-Tokens(NFTs) and Decentralized Finance(DeFi) related applications as well as general Crypto related trends and potentially predict future ones.</p>
<p>Data Analytics platforms in the Blockchain space are gaining users as the whole crypto ecosystem evolves and is becoming harder to navigate. With substantial recent investments in this area,<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup> it is clear that the investors are showing interest in what these platforms can do and the potential they have in shaping the future of Blockchain.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This research focuses on the type of information that can be extracted from the blockchain, elaborates on where that information can be used and signals the utility that lies in it - especially in the NFT and DeFi related applications that dominate the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Out of the scope of the research falls the aquiring/storing/organizing/displaying of the raw data which are extremely hard and complex processes that also open questions about the decentralization of those processes and the integrity of the collected data.</p>
<p>Instead, it casts a light on the current state of the Data Analytics / Blockchain intersection, top platforms that operate in it and the tools that they provide. These platforms/tools are then categorized based on area where they are used and their use cases briefly explained.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>Data Analytics platforms/tools enable users to make sense of this rapidly changing space and so the importance of this explorative research lies in the fact that they are relatively new with a huge potential and as such must be investigated further.</p>
<p><strong>The goal</strong> of this research is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>explore, explain and categorise Data Analytics platforms and their tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The methodology</strong> of the research includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>taking into account only platforms that support Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains</p></li>
<li><p>discussing where a platform/tool can be used</p></li>
<li><p>categorizing a platform/tool as one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Purpose</strong> - contains both of the other categories as well as some additional functionality</li>
<li><strong>NFT specific</strong> - focuses on providing information about a collection/NFT or the NFT market in general</li>
<li><strong>DeFi specific</strong> - focuses on the extracting metrics for specific DeFi projects and DeFi market in general</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>With those three categories explained above, platforms can be investigated and then grouped. Regarding the distribution of categories that will be elaborated on it is evident that most platforms/tools are not general purpose ones. They require a lot of time to develop and so there is an emerging trend of developing specizalised ones that are easier to develop and target a single niche.</p>
<p>In the following text categories are listed in order, with each category being divided into “Tools” and “Platforms” sections. In the “Tools” section, each entry describes a specific functionality and the “Platforms” section focuses on illustrative platforms that have those functionalities (among others) incorporated into them.</p>
<p>Platforms/tools from the same/different categories are not mutually exclusive and can be combined.</p>
<section id="general-purpose" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-purpose">General Purpose</h2>
<section id="tools" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>Tools in this category query information about the complete transaction activity of a specific address (both Externally-Owned-Accounts (EOA) and Smart Contracts) and groups the extracted information into human readable metrics.</p>
<section id="contract-interactions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contract-interactions">Contract interactions</h4>
<p>For any choosen contract it is possible to extract general information about the:</p>
<ul>
<li>transaction count</li>
<li>unique addresses</li>
<li>token inflow/outflow</li>
</ul>
<p>for a specific timeframe. These values can then be organized and monitored over a larger time periods to provide information about the latest trends and changes in the number of users, who these users are, etc.</p>
<p>They can also be used to detect contracts that were recently deployed that are gaining popularity as to investigate the project with which those contracts are associated with.</p>
<p>More valuable information would be tied to how the contract is being used - what methods are being called, their sequence, etc. To extract meaningfull data, as it was discussed above, there would need to exist a parser with a specific domain knowledge.</p>
</section>
<section id="address-profiler" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="address-profiler">Address Profiler</h4>
<p>For any user address of interest, it is possible to extract the information about the :</p>
<ul>
<li>portfolio (all of the assets that the address holds)</li>
<li>estimated portfolio value (sum of values of NFT* and ERC20 holdings)</li>
<li>recent token trades (both ERC20 and NFTs)</li>
<li>addresses that the user has interacted with</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these values can also be monitored since the beginning of the chain’s history and addresses can be grouped together to provide some form of live feed for those that are most interesting either to the user or to the platform itself.</p>
<p>*Estimated value of an NFT is platform specific (i.e.&nbsp;see<sup>3</sup>)</p>
</section>
<section id="alerts" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alerts">Alerts</h4>
<p>Alerts are delivered to the user, via a communication channel of choice (Telegram, Text Message, Discord, …), when a certain customly defined condition is met - some address buys an NFT, collection’s floor price has increased/decreased by some margin, …</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="platforms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="platforms">Platforms</h3>
<p>Two of the top plaftforms in this category are <a href="https://nansen.ai">Nansen</a> and <a href="dune.xyz">Dune Analytics</a> which can be used to gather and analyze similar information but take two drastically different approaches - user oriented and business oriented, respectively.</p>
<section id="nansen.ai" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nansen.ai">Nansen.ai</h4>
<p>This paid platform doesn’t require or demand from user to have technical knowledge and it provides detailed non-customizable dashboards for General purpose, NFT and DeFi specific tools. Almost all of the tools (from the three categories) listed in this paper, in one form or another, are supported by Nansen making it the most comprehensive and beginner friendly platform.</p>
<p>An interesting additional feature that Nansen provides is labeling of some addresses as being “Smart Money” (addresses that were early adopters and/or have made smart decisions in the NFT and/or DeFi space)*. There exist specific dashboards/sections where it is shown what the “Smart Money” is doing - what are they minting/buying/selling, with whom they are interacting, etc. This information can be used by the user to decide what they think is a good strategy for them when investing and can be combined with custom alerts when a certain condition is met.</p>
<p>*See<sup>4</sup> for more details on the labeling of these addresses.</p>
</section>
<section id="duneanalytics.com" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="duneanalytics.com">DuneAnalytics.com</h4>
<p>Dune Analytics translates raw on-chain transaction data into SQL databases such that the information can be requested using SQL queries. Custom vizualizations (charts, graphs, …) and dashboards can be created from those queries which can then be embedded into other websites.</p>
<p>Additional benefit of the platform is that there exists an active community of members who can create dashboards for which both the visualizations and the SQL queries are publicly avaliable. This enables them to build upon on another’s work, making a powerfull snowball effect.</p>
<p>There exist, however, two drawbacks to the platform:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>only the platfrom itself can perfom the parsing of smart contracts (users can request a contract to be parsed)</li>
<li>doesn’t provide an API (though paid users can export results as a CSV file)</li>
</ol>

<section id="nft-specific" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nft-specific">NFT specific</h2>
<section id="tools-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tools-1">Tools</h3>
<section id="market-overviewtrends" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="market-overviewtrends">Market Overview/Trends</h4>
<p>Contains information about the whole NFT market and specific marketplaces, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>number of distinct users (minters/buyers/sellers)</li>
<li>trading volume</li>
<li>average price of all NFTs sold</li>
<li>floor price (taking into account all NFTs listed)</li>
<li>trending collections</li>
</ul>
<p>These values are then used to analyze the percentage share of a marketplace compared to the whole market which is useful to determine the top marketplaces and capture the moment when there is a drastic shift in the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The tool also helps in discovering new trending NFT collections and on which marketplace is the most of the trading activity for that collection happening thus answering the question where to go to when considering to invest in it.</p>
</section>
<section id="collection-breakdown" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collection-breakdown">Collection Breakdown</h4>
<p>Contains information tied to a specific collection and involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic information (number of distinct holders, average price, volume, price range, number of trades…)</li>
<li>balance changes (how many NFTs were bought/sold/minted by an address)</li>
<li>rarity stats - what traits are the rarest and thus more valuable</li>
<li>recent mints/trades</li>
<li>similar collections</li>
</ul>
<p>This data can be used to determine whether the majority of NFTs from the collection are held by few addresses which is a bad position for other holders as those addresses can quickly unload the NFTs, selling them at lower prices and so driving the floor price for the entire collection down.</p>
<p>It can also be used to assess the confidence of NFT holders in the collection by seeing if long term holders are suddenly started selling or if the collection is gaining momentum (for example, a lot of trades by different addresses in a short period of time).</p>
<p>All of this can be used by the users to develop unique NFT trading strategies, making this tool extremely informative.</p>
</section>
<section id="nft-breakdown" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nft-breakdown">NFT Breakdown</h4>
<p>This tool focuses on a specific NFT from a collection and displays</p>
<ul>
<li>history of trades - changes in ownership and price</li>
<li>similar NFTs (based on traits)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the obvious use case is tracking the price movement of that NFT but another one is tracking at the same time the price movement of similar NFTs and buying those that seem undervalued (ofter reffered as “sniping”).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="platforms-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="platforms-1">Platforms</h3>
<p>All of the previously listed tools are supported by Nansen but there are specialized alternatives that perform limited subset of those functionalities in a same/slightly different way. Some of the popular ones are <a href="https://icy.tools">icy.tools</a>, <a href="https://moby.gg">moby.gg</a> and <a href="https://nftnerds.ai">NFTNerds.ai</a>.</p>

<section id="total-value-locked-tvl-tracker" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="total-value-locked-tvl-tracker">Total Value Locked (TVL) Tracker</h4>
<p>TVL s the overall value of crypto assets deposited in a specific DeFi protocol – or in DeFi protocols generally. It is often analyzed to determine the oportunities across chains and protocols. When analyzed over longer periods of time it can help in discovering new project trends.</p>
</section>
<section id="recent-activity-tracker" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recent-activity-tracker">Recent Activity Tracker</h4>
<p>This tool gathers in real time the latest transactions that happened on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), Lending/borrowing and Derivatives platforms. Using it, it is possible to detect and take into account large funds movement by an address that is of interest.</p>
</section>
<section id="stakinglendingliquidity-metrics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stakinglendingliquidity-metrics">Staking/Lending/Liquidity Metrics</h4>
<p>These metrics revolve around the number of lenders/borrowers/stakers of a DeFi platform, their current and past balances (including deposits/withdrawals/liquidations) as well as the distribution of token holders.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="platforms-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="platforms-2">Platforms</h3>
<p>Dune Analytics is very useful in this area as the most useful information is DeFi platform specific and needs to be analyzed in a different way. For general, comparable information there are <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse</a> and <a href="https://defillama.com/">DeFi Llama</a>.</p>
</section>

</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Using Data Analytics platforms, it is possible to track and analyze the performance of a portfolio for any address and to learn from their past experiences. They are also useful in determining the differences between the most sucessfull and least successful addresses as well as what they have in common. These groups of addresses can then be monitored for future transactions and can alert an user when they happen. Users can then assess the new information and act accordingly.</p>
<p>The bottleneck of this process lies in the human factor that does information assessing manually and so a lot of time is spent on it. Improvements can be made by automating the decision process that leads to the action. Since it would be dealing with real funds, a machine could suggest a potential sequence of actions and the user would still need to aprove it by signing the corresponding transactions.</p>
<p>For example, in NFT trading, a bot could monitor all trades in realtime and detect an increase/decrease in the popularity of a collection which would signal it to buy/sell an NFT or a set of NFTs and suggest the price of it - at what price to list an NFT or what offer to make.</p>
<p>This, and other use cases from specific niches would need to be studied further, as part of a separate research. There exists a question on the utility of those tools, however, their functionalities are in a large measure dependant on the Data Analytics and so their whole processing pipeline would need to be carefully designed.</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>This research examines Ape The Ethereum Development Framework For Python Developers. It examines its plugin system and ease of use. As a conclusion Web3 Tech Radar location is suggested.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Ape is a new tool for creating and exploring on Ethereum and other blockchains. This framework is written in python with a goal of onboarding more python developers to Web3 thus providing much needed inclusivity in the space.</p>
<p>Their goal is to make development smoother with their modular approach. Ape is centered around their open-source plugins written in python; some of them are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ape-hardhat - Hardhat network provider for Ape</li>
<li>Ape-infura - Infura provider plugins for Ethereum-based networks</li>
<li>Ape-solidity - Support for Solidity smart contracts</li>
<li>Ape-ledger - Ledger Nano S and X plugin for Ape</li>
<li>Ape-alchemy - Alchemy Provider plugins for Ethereum-based networks</li>
</ol>
<p><em>There are over 20 plugins Ape offers. Considering the open-source nature of the project a lot of new plugins are on the way.</em></p>
<p>Current version of Ape is <strong>v0.2.1</strong> and some of the new interesting features offered are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Fantom support. Developers can build multi-chain applications with ape’s network switching feature.</li>
<li>Impersonated account. This let’s the developers test their project and interact with the contract on a fork network pretending to be any account. If you want to impersonate Vitalik, Ape makes that possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>They are also working on Ape Project Templates which should increase productivity and enhance developers’ experience when using this framework. Some of the templates Ape is currently developing are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>NFT template</li>
<li>Token template</li>
<li>Various other templates for airdrops,minting</li>
<li>Templates for different ERC standards</li>
</ol>
<p>Ape is also set out to be the “first professional-grade smart contract development framework to support multi-chain application development, including non-EVM chains like StarkWare” .[^1]</p>
<p>Another sign that Ape is growing is that a Yearn.Finance repo has <a href="https://github.com/yearn/veYFI/pull/98?utm_campaign=Updates%20from%20ApeWorX&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">officially migrated</a> over from Brownie to Ape.</p>
<p>As previosly mentioned, this is a new framework and we are expecting more adoption and improvements in the coming months, especially as more developers “take it for a spin”.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that there is a possibility of developers switching to Ape from Brownie framework, as Brownie updates <a href="https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie/issues/1515">have slowed down</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The goal of this research paper is to explore this new player in the smart contract frameworks market, this is an opportunity to explore a new framework that is python oriented.</p>
<p>This will be done by writing a simple smart contract, deployment script for rinkeby and a couple tests for said contract and examining the documentation and tutorials present. That way we can research the ease of use for both beginners and experienced developers, and see what is the approach to development process this open-source framework is taking.</p>
<p>As a result Web3 Tech Radar location for this framework will be suggested.</p>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p><strong>Beginner friendly?</strong></p>
<p>After initial testing of this framework and considering the state of the documentation at this stage I would recommend this framework to experienced python developers venturing into Web3. Documentation is well written, still in the works and continuosly updated with contributions from the community around this framework. Apeworx Team and Apeworx community is currently working on workshops to get developers up to speed and tutorials are in the works.</p>
<p>Currently there is little materials for newcomers. Considering this is a new open-source project this is understandable. However, for absolute beginners, going through the Brownie framework first is recomended at this stage of Ape’s development. The reason for that is abundance of tutorials, workshops and well written documentation. After Brownie, switch to Ape and its plugin system is smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
<p>Ape framework performs well. Smart contract was developed and deployed to Rinkeby test network using a python script without any problems. Verification of the contract on Etherscan via a python script is not yet possible but is in the works in the Etherscan plugin.</p>
<p>Testing works well both locally and when using network forks, which makes exhaustive testing possible. Currently Ape doesn’t include built-in smart contract fuzz-testing tool.</p>
<p>Currently the speed of the framework is satisfactory and more improvements are on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins:</strong></p>
<p>Open-source modular plugins are definitely the highlight of this framework. It allows developers to easily install and remove the functionality they need in their development process and I could see this being a way to onboard new developers from the python world and a way to incentivize developers to develop their own plugins. Some of the interesting Ape plugins are:</p>
<p><strong>ape-tokens</strong> is an interesting plugin which allows developers to get token contracts without putting in the addresses themselves.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">from</span> ape_tokens <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> tokens</span>
<span id="cb1-2"></span>
<span id="cb1-3">link <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> tokens[<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"LINK"</span>]</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">print</span>(link.address)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will print out the eth adress of the LINK token. “link” can now be used in various python scripts, be it testing or development.</p>
<p><strong>ape-ledger</strong> is a plugin for Ape Framework which integrates with Ledger devices to load and create accounts, sign messages, and sign transactions.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>have the Ledger USB device connected</li>
<li>have the Ledger USB device unlocked (by entering the passcode)</li>
<li>have the Ethereum app open.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ledger accounts have the following capabilities in ape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can sign transactions</li>
<li>Can sign messages using the default EIP-191 specification</li>
<li>Can sign messages using the EIP-712 specification</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ape-trezor</strong> is a plugin for Ape Framework which integrates Trezorlib ethereum.py to load and create accounts, sign messages, and sign transactions.</p>
<p>You can load the account like any other account in Ape console and then use it to sign transactions like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1">ape trezor sign<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span>message [YOUR TREZOR ALIAS] <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"hello world"</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">ape trezor verify <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"hello world</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The output of verify should be the same address as the account $account_name.</p>
<p><strong>Ape Polygon Ecosystem Plugin</strong> - Ecosystem Plugin for Polygon support in Ape</p>
<p><strong>Ape Fantom Ecosystem Plugin - Ecosystem Plugin for Fantom support in Ape</strong></p>
<p><strong>ape-addressbook</strong> is plugin that allows tracking addresses and contracts in projects and globally. This is an interesting way to improve developers user experience and is currently in development.</p>
<p><em>…And many more.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p><strong>Tech Radar Proposal:</strong></p>
<p>Recommended location is the Assess ring at this stage. The reason for that is the shere novelty of this framework. However the development team is great, community is growing and we are seeing new projects emerging using Ape. This framework is with its simplicity aiming to become the industry standard in Ethereum development for python developers and is on a great way to do so.</p>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>JSON Web Tokens, or JWT, are the format of JSON encoded data structures for authorizing clients on the Web. Some JWT payloads have a specific standardized structure, defined by the protocol, such as OAuth(2) tokens. Others, however, are designed specifically for particular apps.</p>
<p>Authorization on the Blockchain is done mainly through explicitly whitelisting addresses that are allowed to perform specific actions. Whitelisting introduces high costs when the number of whitelisted addresses is large. A good example is ICO whitelisting, where hundreds or even thousands of participants need to get whitelisted.</p>
<p>This research aims to find an efficient, more cost-effective solution for authorizing users on the Blockchain using a system of authorization tokens issued and received off-chain, without the Blockchain transaction fees, and which will be valid on-chain and off-chain. In addition, the token structure should be transferrable off-chain as a JWT token, compatible with the OAuth2 standard, and reusable in both Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 worlds.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Ethereum Blockhain gas prices are following the price of Ether, resulting in higher transaction fees. The cost of 1 ETH on January 1st, 2019, was $140.82 [1]. On the same day in 2022, the price for 1 ETH was $3,769.70 [2]. That means that the same transaction from 2019 became just three years later became more than 30 times more expensive.</p>
<p>Executing transactions on Blockchain, in general, doesn’t require any specific authorization. The transactions are signed using the private key and paid using ETH from the signer’s wallet. However, some transactions, such are token purchases during ICOs, require explicit approval by the smart contract owner. The approval on the Blockchain is done by whitelisting wallet addresses that are allowed to perform specific actions, submitting the list of the whitelisted wallets, and storing them on the Blockchain. The price of each transaction for storing whitelisted wallets linearly grows by the number of the wallets.</p>
<p>In a more concrete example, storing one 20 byte address on Blockchain, having ETH at the January 1st, 2022 price, costs approximately 20000 GAS or around $5.6, having an average gas price of 74 Gwei. With those prices, storing a hundred whitelisted addresses would cost about $565, with base transaction cost included. It is challenging for technology to expand with such high prices for such basic requirements.</p>
<p>Before introducing the solution this research is proposing, it is essential first to briefly introduce some basic concepts regarding the existing methods for authorization on the Web.</p>
<section id="oauth-standard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oauth-standard">OAuth standard</h2>
<p>Open Authorization, or OAuth for short, is an authorization standard followed by many APIs worldwide. The standard specifies the protocol between client and authorization server and data transferred in protocol messages. There are two versions of OAuth standard, 1 and 2.</p>
<p>OAuth standard doesn’t specify the transfer method for sending messages, but one widely adopted standard is using JWT tokens as the authorization data container.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jwt-tokens">JWT Tokens</h2>
<p>In 2015, Michael Jones, John Bradley and Nat Sakimura introduced JSON Web Tokens (JWT) through RFC-7519 as a compact structure for representing claims transferred between two parties [3]. Since then, JWTs have been used for client authentication on the Web. Initially, the authentication was performed between APIs but quickly found use in client authentication following the growth of client-heavy applications.</p>
<p>JWT has a general structure, made of a header, body, and signature segments. The header segment includes the token type and a label of the algorithm used for creating signatures.</p>
<p>Example JWT header</p>
<pre><code>{
    "type": "JWT",
    "alg": "ES256"
}</code></pre>
<p>The body segment is a container segment used for storing protocol-specific information. OAuth 2.0 standard, introduced with RFC-6749 [4], specifies several fields required for authorization that are members of the body of a JWT token. Some of those fields are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aud</code> (Audience) - Identifier of the user to whom the client will present the token for executing an action</li>
<li><code>exp</code> (Expiration) - Token expiration timestamp</li>
<li><code>iss</code> (Issuer) - Identifier of the token issuer, authorization service provider</li>
<li><code>scope</code> (Action scope) - List of actions for which the token owner would be authorized to perform</li>
<li><code>sub</code> (Subject) - Identifier of the token owner</li>
<li><code>iat</code> (Issued at) - Isusing timestamp</li>
</ul>
<p>Example JWT Body</p>
<pre><code>{
  "sub": "user1",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022,
  "aud": "server1",
  "scope": ["data.fetching"]
}</code></pre>
<p>Field <code>name</code> in the JWT body example represents a custom, application-specific data field.</p>
<p>The signature part of the JWT token contains the hash or signature of the token provided by the token issuer.</p>
<p>The three token parts are put together into one base64 encoded string (without trailint <code>=</code> symbols), having the tree parts separated by the dot <code>.</code> symbol.</p>

<section id="general-authorization-protocol" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-authorization-protocol">General Authorization Protocol</h2>
<p>A general protocol for client authorization on the Web using JWT tokens consists of two steps: - Requesting token from the authorization server for executing some action - Presenting the authorization token received from the authorization server to the server which would perform the requested action</p>
</section>
<section id="existing-approaches" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="existing-approaches">Existing Approaches</h2>
<p>There are some existing approaches for combining the Blockchain and OAuth tokens. In one such research [5], the authors used NFTs as authorization tokens generated on-chain that would be verifiable using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. That approach is inverse to this research: it doesn’t reduce costs but puts authorization tokens on the chain.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The main goal of this research was to find a way to make authorization on the Web cheaper than the existing whitelisting method with the general idea to build a solution analogous to the current, proven methods for authorization on the Web. The key motivation for using tokens as an authorization method is an authorization protocol that shifts significant transaction fees from one authorization entity to many clients that pay only a small additional fee on top of the price they pay for executing the authorized action.</p>
<p>Reducing the price paid by the authorization entity by 100% can be achieved by issuing authorization tokens off-chain. This protocol specification introduces challenges regarding the design of the token, as the token should include all the information that the authorization entity would provide with the Blockchain transaction in the first place.</p>
<p>Reducing the costs of additional fees that clients would now pay for the authorization requires the overhead authorization data submitted on the Blockchain to be as small as possible. This requirement poses the main challenge for token design. Additionally, the Blockchain should not explicitly store authorization data, except as transaction arguments.</p>
<p>Combining these requirements, a perfect authorization schema represents a two-step protocol where the client first acquires the authorization token from the authorization server, off-chain. Second, the client submits the data required for performing the action to the Blockchain with a minor (ideally none) overhead the smart contract would use to confirm the client’s authorization.</p>
<section id="chain-token-ct-representation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chain-token-ct-representation">Chain token (CT) representation</h2>
<p>The essential requirements for the token that would be used on the chain are: - Efficient verifiability; token should be efficiently verifiable on the chain - Authenticity; the probability of token forgery should be negligible - Succinctness; token should be small in byte size - Non-transferability; token should be used only by the user who received the token</p>
<p>As an example throughout this research, we will use the money checkout allowance problem, where a client needs to be authorized to payout a certain amount of money from the account of the authorizing entity. An existing approach for solving this problem is calling the approval method on the smart contract or whitelisting clients and explicitly approving the total allowed amount for each client. Method signature without a token argument would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>payout(address account, address receiver, uint256 amount)</code></pre>
<p>A naive approach for constructing a token that would follow JWT logic would be providing all the values bound by the token. In our example, the values that are required for money checkout from the account are: - account owner identifier; 20 bytes address value - authorized client identifier; 20 bytes address value - allowed amount; 32 bytes value</p>
<p>Next, the apparent problem is a forgery. Everyone can create a token with listed values and submit it on the Blockchain. The solution for this problem is to provide a signature made by the authorization entity, which confirms the provided values. Ethereum signatures contain three segments, v, r, and s, 65 bytes long. All summed up to 137 bytes of memory. Even if this doesn’t look like a significant sum, the main issue is that the token size asymptotically grows by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O(n)">, linearly with the number of arguments n.&nbsp;In other words, it would become costly, or even unusable, for methods with more arguments. It is not very efficient, but it is a start.</p>
<section id="token-size-optimization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="token-size-optimization">Token size optimization</h3>
<p>The problem with the naive approach is linear growth with the number of arguments. Solving this problem requires looking closely at the method that is being called. The method <code>payout</code> already contains the token values as a method argument, and it would be redundant to provide them again in the token. The same pattern is visible with different use-cases. This observation suggests that we can avoid providing the values within the token but use only a hash of the approved values and check if the hash of the provided input values matches the token hash. Using the hashing method clears the linear growth of the token as the size of the keccak256 hash is fixed to 32 bytes in length, achieving a constant <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?O(1)"> size of the token. The hash can also cover other values that could be hard-coded into the smart contract without a token size increase, which will become an essential feature in later sections.</p>
</section>
<section id="signature-size-optimization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="signature-size-optimization">Signature size optimization</h3>
<p>The Ethereum signature size is fixed to 65 bytes. That means that it passes the size of 2 memory words (32 bytes in size) and requires three blocks of memory. The solution for this problem comes with EIP-2098 [6], which proposes a simple technique for compact signature representation, reducing its size by 1 byte and allowing it to fit into two memory blocks.</p>
<p>The total token size is now fixed to 32 bytes of token hash plus another 64 bytes of signature data totaling 96 bytes or three blocks of memory.</p>
</section>
<section id="mapping-oauth2.0-parameters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mapping-oauth2.0-parameters">Mapping OAuth2.0 parameters</h3>
<p>Now that we have a token structure, we need to figure out how to standardize token parameters to comply with the OAuth2.0 standard.</p>
<p>The audience parameter refers to the smart contract containing the payout method. It doesn’t need to be provided explicitly as a method argument as it is already encoded in the smart contract.</p>
<p>The token issuer can be deduced from the signature and doesn’t need to be explicitly provided.</p>
<p>The subject parameter is provided both as the input argument of the <code>payout</code> method. It doesn’t have to be provided explicitly. It should not be provided even as the argument, as it is already given as the message sender value.</p>
<p>The scope parameter describes the action that should be executed. It should not be explicitly provided as it should be hardcoded in the method.</p>
<p>The token expiration time is a tricky one. It doesn’t naturally belong to method arguments, so it should be provided explicitly. To prevent the token size increase, we can do a simple modification of the token hash. The value of the timestamp can be stored in 8 bytes. A straightforward solution is to provide another method argument with an 8-byte value. A more elegant solution is to transform the keccak256 value into “pseudo-keccak224” (SHA224 [7] value, with unchanged initialization value) by truncating the hash size to its 224 bytes prefix and appending 8 bytes extension with expiration timestamp as the last 8 bytes of the token hash. This transformation returns us to the previously proposed token size without extra arguments.</p>
<p>As we can see, all the crucial parameters of the OAuth2.0 protocol can be successfully mapped to the Blockchain transactions and the chain token.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="token-reusability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="token-reusability">Token reusability</h2>
<p>Some authorization tokens are reusable many times until the expiration date. However, some use-cases require that the tokens may be used only once. An example of such a use case is exactly the example we have used so far. Once the payout method has been executed, the user should not be able to perform double-payout transactions. This problem can be solved the same way as in Web 2.0 - by introducing a payment identifier. The payment identifier should be included as an extra method argument and included in the token hash. This solution also solves the issue of the lost token, as the token can be reissued with the same payment identifier and used for the same payment only once. Specific use cases may require the existence of only one token. In that case, the token (and method arguments) may include <code>jti</code> parameter or JWT token ID as a token identifier or use the token hash as an identifier. The smart contract should implement mechanisms for preventing double payments and a potential blacklisting of tokens.</p>
</section>
<section id="action-scope-schemas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="action-scope-schemas">Action scope schemas</h2>
<p>OAuth2.0 proposes a parameter that includes the action scope or label of the action for which the client can use the token. Action scopes are not specified as they can be represented using any string value. The problem here is the cost of using string data types in smart contracts. This research proposes restriction for action type values to numerical data types of 4 bytes. This restriction allows <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5E32"> possible scope values that could represent many use cases.</p>
<p>A library of token schemas can help developers properly format their tokens based on scope number schemas. Furthermore, enumeration of action types can introduce standardization for tokens where a smart contract may require, for example, “scope 42” tokens for executing a method. We present the first two token scopes that would be used in the following use-cases:</p>
<section id="scope-1-generic-identity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope-1-generic-identity">Scope 1: Generic Identity</h3>
<p>Generic identity scope should be used for verification of the client’s identity. The verification is based on the client’s wallet address and unique identifier in the issuer’s database. The hash for “scope 1” tokens be made by hashing the following array of values in their respective order: - <code>address iss</code>; token issuer <code>address aud</code>; smart contract address or 0 address for general identification - <code>address sub</code>; client’s wallet address - <code>uint4 scope</code>; action scope with value <code>1</code> for generic identification - <code>bytes32 uuid</code>; unique identifier of the client in the issuer’s - <code>uint8 exp</code>; token expiration timestamp in UNIX timestamp format database ### Scope 2: Allowance Allowance tokens, used for crypto cheques, should have hashes made by hashing the following array of values in their respective order: - <code>address iss</code>; token issuer - <code>address aud</code>; smart contract address - <code>address sub</code>; money receiver - <code>uint4 scope</code>; action scope with value <code>2</code> for allowance - <code>bytes32 paymentId</code>; payment identifier (NOTE: token hash may be used as payment ID but it can introduce new problems) - <code>uint256 amount</code>; amount to transfer - <code>uint8 exp</code>; token expiration timestamp in UNIX timestamp format</p>
<p>The reader may notice that in both cases, there are two logical groups of parameters: - general parameters; <code>iss</code>, <code>aud</code>, sub<code>,</code>scope<code>and</code>exp<code>- application-specific parameters;</code>userId<code>,</code>paymentId<code>,</code>amount`</p>
<p>The general parameters are the same for all tokens, and application-specific parameters are different for each scope.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="from-chain-token-ct-to-omni-web-token-owt">From Chain Token (CT) to Omni Web Token (OWT)</h2>
<p>Now that we have the complete definition of the chain token, we can go one more step and make it usable and transferrable in the Web 2.0 world. We can do this by packing chain token data as part of theJWT token, following the OAuth 2.0 schema.</p>
<section id="owt-body" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="owt-body">OWT Body</h3>
<p>The token scopes define OAuth 2.0 parameters, so the only remaining thing is appropriately packing the chain token into the JWT body and creating a proper JWT signature. The verifier needs to know the CT hash value and the parameters used in the construction of the token.</p>
<p>The proposed OWT body schema is:</p>
<pre><code>{
    aud: &lt;smart contract address&gt;,
    iss: &lt;issuer's wallet address&gt;,
    scope: &lt;readable name of the scope&gt;,
    exp: &lt;token expiration timestamp&gt;
    chain_token: {
        token_hash: &lt;CT hash with expiration timestamp&gt;,

                    value: &lt;parameter value&gt;,

<section id="owt-signature" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="owt-signature">OWT Signature</h3>
<p>The JWT standard allows using the Ethereum secp256k1 signatures by providing the <code>EC256</code> algorithm type value in the token header. The signature of the OWT token is created using the issuer’s private key. To verify the signature, the verifier needs access to the issuer’s public key, which should be available from the issuer’s <code>/.well-known/jwks.json</code> route of the authorization API.</p>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 protocol allows using <code>client id</code> and <code>client secret</code> parameters when requesting the authorization tokens.

<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>To test our hypothesis and estimate the costs of working with OWTs, a simple NodeJS library for generating and verifying OWTs was implemented together with testing REST API for issuing OWTs following the OAuth 2.0 protocol. An example smart contract for testing the usability of the chain token was also implemented.</p>
<p>The smart contract used for testing included four methods: - <code>whitelist(address client, uint256 amount)</code> method for whitelisting the user for a given amount of money - <code>payoutOld(uint256 amount)</code> method for performing payout in the old fashioned way by checking the whitelisted amount - <code>payoutNew(address sender, uint256 amount, bytes32 paymentId, bytes32[3] calldata token)</code> method for performing payout using the chain token following “scope 2” schema - <code>payoutNewShort(address sender, uint256 amount, bytes32[3] calldata token)</code> method for performing payout using the chain token but without payment identifier, having token hash as a payment identifier - <code>verifyIdentity(address issuer, bytes32 userId, bytes32[3] calldata token)</code> method for simple verification of the client’s identity following “scope 1” schema</p>
<section id="allowance-use-case" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="allowance-use-case">Allowance Use Case</h2>
<p>The allowance use case tested the token issuing protocol for payout allowances, evaluated the costs of performing payouts using the token, and compared the results with the basic whitelisting protocol.</p>
<section id="test-setup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-setup">Test setup</h3>
<p>Authorization entity submitted allowance amount for the client using the <code>whitelist</code> smart contract method. The cost of the whitelisting transaction was 44,484 gas.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-1-payout-by-whitelisting">Test 1: Payout by Whitelisting</h3>
<p>The client executed the <code>payoutOld</code> method of the smart contract with a propper allowance amount. The cost of the payout transaction was 22,389 + T gas.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-2-payout-with-token" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-2-payout-with-token">Test 2: Payout with Token</h3>
<p>The client requested an OWT from the authorization server using OAuth 2.0 request schema. The authorization server verified the client’s credentials and issued a “scope 2” token to the client with a specified allowance amount. The client verified the OWT data and extracted the chain token and its parameters from the OWT. After the OWT verification step, the client submitted them to the smart contract using the <code>payoutNew</code> method. The payout was successful, and the execution cost was 59,935 + T gas.</p>
</section>
<section id="test-3-payout-with-token-using-token-hash-as-payment-identifier" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="test-3-payout-with-token-using-token-hash-as-payment-identifier">Test 3: Payout with Token using Token Hash as Payment Identifier</h3>
<p>The protocol for issuing and verifying the OWT was done the same way as in the previous test. The only difference was that the token did not follow the “scope 2” schema but left out the payment identifier. The client performed a payout using the <code>payoutNewShort</code> method. Again, the payout was successful, and the execution cost was 59,189 + T gas.</p>
</section>
<section id="cost-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cost-analysis">Cost Analysis</h3>
The test results show that the cost of the payout protocol using whitelisting was 44,484 gas for the issuer and 22,389 gas for the client, resulting in 66,873 gas for the entire protocol. Test 2 showed that using the token has reduced the issuer’s costs to 0, but the client’s cost was increased to 59,935 gas which is 37,546 gas more than in test 1. Interestingly, the overhead cost for the client is lower than the costs of the issuer’s whitelisting, which indicates that using the token reduces the issuer’s fees, compared to whitelisting, even if the issuer compensates the overhead client’s costs by increasing the allowance amount. Test 3 showed that using token hash as payment identifier reduces the costs for extra 746 gas. However, this introduces problems with token reissuing. The exact token needs to be reissued every time the original one gets lost, requiring the expiration timestamp to be the same as the original one for the hashes to match and thus have the same payment identifier. This situation can cause the issuer to be unable to reissue the token as its timestamp has already expired. The results of the cost analysis are presented in Table 1. <br><br>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generic-identity-use-case">Generic Identity Use Case</h2>
<p>The generic identity use case tested the issuing and verification of the “scope 1” tokens and assessed the costs of using identification tokens on the chain.</p>
<p>The client acquired OWT from the authorization server and submitted the token with the received user id from the issuer’s database. The client submitted the token to the <code>verifyIdentity</code> method of the smart contract and successfully verified the identity token. The cost of the verification was 36,816 gas, which suggests that the verification proces cost was 15,817 gas, leaving out the base transaction cost.</p>
<section id="use-case-analysis" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-case-analysis">Use case analysis</h3>
<p>The test showed that the costs for verifying the identity tokens are low and open a new path for the identity representations valid on multiple chains.

<p>The entire verification protocol can be summed up into a token verification smart contract that can be deployed and used by multiple users to verify the authorization tokens for their smart contracts. Blacklisting can be introduced for tokens or clients. This service should allow listing approved issuers and smart contract addresses from which the requests may come. Also, the service can be monetized by requiring a certain amount of Ethers or ERC-20 tokens to be submitted monthly by the users to the verification smart contract, or the service will become unavailable for the requests coming from the user’s smart contracts.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The test results show that the OWTs and the chain tokens can cover a variety of use cases while introducing standardization in token construction, issuing, and verification. Operating with OWTs reduces costs for the services requiring whitelisting while enabling new multi-chain use cases thanks to a succinct yet general token structure and easy verification. The following steps would include defining more token schemas covering miscellaneous use cases and implementing the General Purpose Token Verification Service.</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The main topic of this research is exploring the possibility and the need to create the “Authority” protocol that would handle blacklisting based on community voting and assessment. This protocol would mint the untransferable NFT to the blacklisted address. Creating this solutions (both the platform and the NFT) would not be challenging but the need for these solutions is questionable to the author. This paper explored the current blacklist cases and the possibility of creating the said NFTs. The Tether case is in the main focus since the solutions are similar and simple. The main takeaway is that creating this solution is not necessary per se, but the issue is open for discussion.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>When it comes to Web3, security breaches, hacks and malicious behaviour are a big issue. That is why some protocols resort to blacklisting the addressses they deem malicious. Blacklisting is essentially putting the addresses that have engaged in unethical or unacceptable activities on a list which in turn would limit their usage of said protocols.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Initial idea for this research is to explore the possibility of creating a platform that would blacklist addresses and send them an untransferable NFT. This platform would take it upon itself to take care of blacklisting for other protocols and users. The cases would be reported and voted on i.e Nexus Mutual model (for more info on their voting model check ERFC-91). When it comes to problems that this solution would solve the main problem is taking care of blacklisting for other protocols, this in turn makes our solution (even with voting) a point of centralization but more on that in later paragraphs.</p>

<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The goal of this research is to explore how was blacklisting taken care of so far and to explore the possibility and need of creating a protocol that would do this with utilizing untransferable NFTs. Untransferable NFTs have been a topic of interest in the field for a while, otherwise there is no explicit point of including them except for “flagging” the addresses for the world to see.</p>
<p>This will be done by examining the source code of protocols that have done blacklisting in the past. After the examination we will draw some conclusions.</p>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<section id="blacklisting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blacklisting">Blacklisting</h2>
<p>As we pointed above we did a deep-dive into contracts that utilize blacklisting. In the beginning of the research we have searched for contracts that previously used blacklisting and we have come across the Tether case as it is the biggest one. There are various contracts that use the blacklist contracts but it is the exact same approach. When it comes to individual sites and addresses MetaMask already blocks sites that are known to steal funds.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Stablecoin issuer Tether froze the ethereum <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x60891b856cdae4fd0878d45d2768e640be2dc2a50876d20138797a09877a7cd6#eventlog">address</a> holding over $715,000 worth of USDT. This address is the address of hackers who stole $3 million on the Multichain bridge. This means that they cannot move the funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>The question here is how did Tether manage to do that?</li>
</ul>
<p>They managed that by importing the Blacklist contract in their main contract. We will try to explain the contract in the code-box comments below:</p>
<pre><code>contract BlackList is Ownable, BasicToken {

    // Getters to allow the same blacklist to be used also by other contracts.(including upgraded Tether) 
    function getBlackListStatus(address _maker) external constant returns (bool) {
        return isBlackListed[_maker];
    }

    // Returns the owner of the contract address.
    function getOwner() external constant returns (address) {
        return owner;
    }

    // Puts the blacklisted addresses in the mapping for checking and later use.
    mapping (address =&gt; bool) public isBlackListed;

    // Self explanatory, adds the address to the isBlacklisted mapping. Only owner of the contract can call the function
    function addBlackList (address _evilUser) public onlyOwner {
        isBlackListed[_evilUser] = true;
        AddedBlackList(_evilUser);
    }

    // Removes the address from the blacklist and "unfreezes the assets". Only owner of the contract can call the function.
    function removeBlackList (address _clearedUser) public onlyOwner {
        isBlackListed[_clearedUser] = false;
        RemovedBlackList(_clearedUser);
    }

    // Destroys the funds of the blacklisted address and reduces the total suply by the same amount. Only owner of the contract can call this function.
    function destroyBlackFunds (address _blackListedUser) public onlyOwner {
        require(isBlackListed[_blackListedUser]);
        uint dirtyFunds = balanceOf(_blackListedUser);
        balances[_blackListedUser] = 0;
        _totalSupply -= dirtyFunds;
        DestroyedBlackFunds(_blackListedUser, dirtyFunds);
    }
    // Simple events for transaction logs.
    event DestroyedBlackFunds(address _blackListedUser, uint _balance);

    event AddedBlackList(address _user);

    event RemovedBlackList(address _user);

}</code></pre>
<p>Then they simply put the require statement in all their main contract functions(except for the ones with the “Only Owner modifier”) for example:</p>
<pre><code>// Require statement above makes sure the blacklisted address can't access the function.
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public whenNotPaused {
        require(!isBlackListed[_from]);
        if (deprecated) {
            return UpgradedStandardToken(upgradedAddress).transferFromByLegacy(msg.sender, _from, _to, _value);
        } else {
            return super.transferFrom(_from, _to, _value);
        }
    }</code></pre>
<p>This approach to blacklisting gives the Tether the absolute control in what addresses it blacklists and for how long.</p>
<p>As we can see in the getBlacklistStatus the other contracts can use the same Blacklist to limit their usage as Tether thus leaning on their decision making.</p>
<p>In theory a blacklist protocol can be created where the voting what address to blacklist could be done by the community. The said addresses would be stored in the contract and those addresses could be whitelisted by voting again. Then, other contracts could lean on the “list” and block the addresses from using their functions. This would also make our solution the major point of centralization and considering how easy it is to set up blacklisting individually this proposes a question is the such solution needed?</p>
<p>Implementing a separate blacklist functions is not challenging and any contract can include them and have the complete control in what addresses it freezes and for how long.</p>
</section>
<section id="untransferable-nfts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="untransferable-nfts">Untransferable NFTs</h2>
<p>Untrasferable NFTs have been a topic of interest for a while in Web3 and there are various use cases that have been explored. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>identity</li>
<li>badges</li>
<li>achievements, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Vitalik Buterin in his blog post showed his interest in “soulbound NFTs”. If we want these NFTs to be truly soulbound (untrasferable) we would need to block transferability thus limiting them to only one address. When it comes to badges and achievements there are already POAPs. POAP has made the decision not to block transferability of POAPs themselves since the owners might want to change addresses and migrate assets for various reasons. There are various cases where they have been sold or even given out for free and after that sold for the highest bidder.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>When it comes to creating a “soulbound NFT” we think that it is possible and that it can be done by modifying the transfer function from the ERC-721 standard.</p>
<p>The main issue here is utilizing them in the Blacklisting sense, the mint function from the ERC-721 interface can be included in the addBlacklist() function which would mint the said token to the said address. But so far we haven’t come to the use-case except for “flagging” the addresses for the world to see, so it seems unnecessary at the moment.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>When exploring blacklisting we have come to conclusion that it is already implemented in some contracts and that creating a protocol that marks the “malicious” addresses is possible. The untransferable NFTs are possible to create also. The main question here is are those solutions needed? Creating a protocol that others can lean on can be useful but it would also be a major point of centralization and a lot of effort for a feature that simple. Not to mention including untransferable NFTs in the process which at this stage of the research seem unnecessary. What if the address is removed from the blacklist for various reasons does the NFT stay?</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>NFTs have a unique ID and belong to a single wallet. Two standards define what an NFT is and should do: ERC721 and ERC1155, aiming to distinguish each token to be unique. The development of NFT is still in the early stage, and this research shows how NFTs can change their properties. We go through some existing solutions where some events fundamentally affect the NFT, changing its state, properties, or value. We give an overview of those solutions with a desire to cover how they work under the hood and notice potential problems. In the end, are presented possible use cases that open a new door into the NFT word.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) reached incredible popularity in 2021 Ryan Browne<sup>1</sup>. Most of created NFTs are static. We collect it, and we hope its market value will increase. In the case of <em>static</em> NFT, it’s characteristic that its properties and data are immutable and recorded on the blockchain, so such NFTs can’t be changed. Otherwise, there are <em>dynamic</em> NFT for which it’s characteristic that properties and data are mutable, often through oracles that trigger events off-chain system or by interaction with on-chain components, for example, smart contracts other NFTs.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Dynamic NFTs are the logical next step for the NFT space, allowing unique items to evolve, and sometimes decay. This replicates the ephemeral nature of the real world and potentially gives exceptional value to a collected item because of its current state. NFTs transitioning from being ‘only’ static to being dynamic can be thought of as progressing from 2D to 3D, it enables an immense possibility of use cases.” — Adrien Berthou, Head of Crypto-Native Comms at DoinGud</p>

<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>First of all, let’s briefly review some existing projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ether.cards/">EtherCards</a>
<ul>
<li>EtherCards is a dynamic NFT platform that allows anyone to give a base set of traits and requirements and launch their NFT collection so that the EtherCards team can create unique NFTs. Traits can be discounts, special access rights, connections to real-world events, airdrops, upgrades, and other benefits. The ability to have traits allows the creator to maximize the value of their art. Ether Cards is an integrated ecosystem composed of two major parts. Those are the platform and the Ether Cards (an advanced membership NFT card). Anybody can use the EtherCards platform, but the owner of the EtherCards card has certain privileges. Under the hood, EtherCards integrate Chainlink VRF to provide verifiable randomness on-chain. Chainlink allows developers to read data from any external API and blockchain network and perform off-chain computation. That will enable NFTs to be connected to the external world to trigger real-world events, in a word, to be dynamic.</li>
<li>EtherCards have supported and worked with <a href="https://blog.ether.cards/lamelo-ball-nft/">LaMelo Ball</a>, <a href="https://nfttyson.com/">Mike Tyson</a>, <a href="https://blog.ether.cards/steve-aoki-partners-with-ether-cards-to-produce-new-animated-nft-collection-dominion-x/">Steve Aoki</a> and <a href="https://blog.ether.cards/artist-profile-dirty-robot/">DirtyRobot</a>. In the above collections, all NFTs metadata are stored <code>https://client-metadata.ether.cards</code> on the central server. Within that metadata is a link that points to NFTs image on IPFS. So, inside the smart contract, we store points to metadata JSON URIs to all variants of one NFT. Later, inside <code>tokenURI</code> function with the support of Chainlink return dynamically created URI of NFT, only one variant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.loopheads.info/">Loopheads</a>
<ul>
<li>Loopheads is a Loopring ‘Loopring - <span class="nocase">zkRollup Layer2</span> for Trading and Payment’<sup>2</sup> <em>Moody Brains</em> NFT collection, minted on Looprings Layer 2. There are 25 variants for one Loophead avatar(5 different backgrounds and 5 different brain sizes), which one will be displayed depending on the LRC token price using Uniswap Oracles.</li>
<li>All NFT metadata are stored on decentralized storage - IPFS, within that metadata, is a link that sends to NFT’s image on IPFS. So, inside the smart contract, we store points to metadata JSON URIs to all of the Loophead’s variations. When a Loophead NFT is accessed because Loopheads use ERC1155 standard, the Loophead NFT runs the <code>uri</code> function, the start point of dynamic calculation, to show the loophead avatar. The calculation is done with the support of Uniswwap V3 Oracles. That changes parts of the metadata link based on LRC price and returns only one variant.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/reference/periphery/libraries/NFTDescriptor">Uniswap LP NFT</a>
<ul>
<li>On Uniswap V3 liquidity provider(LP) position is represented as NFT. This NFT shows information about liquidity position. Based on the pool and your parameters selected on the liquidity providing interface. The unique NFT will be minted, representing your position in that specific pool. As the owner of this NFT, you can modify or save the position. The best part of this project is that NFT is SVG generated entirely on-chain. Because of that, it is secure as an image not rely on any other service that is not on the blockchain, and it affects the price of that NFT.</li>
<li>All liquidity parameters for NFT are stored on-chain. Interesting is that SVG generation is done inside a pure function, and it returns base64 encoded metadata from the view function.</li>
<li>When a Uniswap V3 LP NFT is accessed because it uses the ERC721 standard, it runs the <code>tokenURI</code> function, which is the start point that generates SVG from liquidity parameters and returns base64 encoded metadata.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.aavegotchi.com/">Aavegotchi</a>
<ul>
<li>Aavegotchi is a crypto collectible game. It was developed to provide users with a new blockchain-based game powered by dynamic NFTs. Aavegotchi information such as Aavegotchi name, traits, and SVG files themselves are saved as contract calldata because it is less gas cost than store in contract storage. The fundamental element of Aavegotchi’s game is randomness. Because of that, they use Chainlink VRF. The main idea behind the game is that the more you love your Aavegotchi character, the more rewards it will give you.</li>
<li>To store SVG, we pass one or more SVG images as a string, along with the information of SVG category type(aavegotchi, collaterals, eyeShapes, wearables) and size of passed SVG images. So inside <code>tokenURI</code> we have all NFTs prepared to return only one determined based on real-life events.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can quickly determine where your NFT is by calling the <code>tokenURI</code> or <code>uri</code> function on the contract, which returns a URI that points to metadata that shows where NFT lives. Above project for NFT storage use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized server</li>
<li>Decentralized storage (IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave)</li>
<li>On-chain storage</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with the central server is that the possibility for manipulation is vast. The server owner can change the JSON scheme of your NFT whenever he wants.</p>
<p>The problem with IPFS is that there is no defined way of data replication. It just happens depending on the relevance of the content. In addition, the IPFS node can become offline. The problem is that if the relevance of our data is minor, the bigger is chance to lose data. To resolve the issue, Filecoin and Arweave come into play. Filecoin is a solution where we pay some price to store data for a set time. The problem is that we are limited by time, so our data are not stored permanently. Arweave is a solution that incentivizes the nodes to hold data permanently by paying only one fee in the Arweave token and keeping data forever. The most significant leak here is that it all comes down to having one storage layer that is separate from the blockchain and from the NFT itself on which it is located.</p>
<p>When it comes to on-chain storage, the SVG is scalable because it does not rely on pixels to display the image. SVG is used for vector graphics where we can describe shapes and lines mathematically. But, if we want to present a more complex image in this format, we get a massive SVG file, which will lead to a considerable gas cost. Additionally, the worth of mention is <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2569">EIP-2569</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>EIP-2569 is an Ethereum improvement proposal to allow a smart contract to save and retrieve an SVG image. Based on that, the two methods contract must have: <code>getTokenImageSvg(uint256) view returns (string memory)</code> and <code>setTokenImageSvg(uint256 tokenId, string memory imagesvg) internal</code>. As we can see, the potential flaw of function <code>setTokenImageSvg</code> as input parameter accepts SVG image string, which can lead to a considerable gas cost in case of complex SVG.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no obstacle to the realization of any project that would require the evolution of NFT. Everything needed is that our contract overrides the <code>tokenURI</code> or <code>uri</code> function from ERC721 or ERC1155. Therefore, the precondition is that we have prepared all parameters variants for the dynamic generation of potential variants. The project specification itself decides which variants to return within it.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This research has shown that it is possible to change the data and properties of NFTs, and the next evaluation in NFT is moving from static NFTs to dynamic NFTs. With dynamic NTFs, some use cases could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An NFT ticket that could retain a value after the event is finished can turn as a discount for a related event or, as some bonus, gifts.</li>
<li>Sports NFT cards can evolve, such as updating their player’s stats or having a limited edition of sports event cards if the player got a super score in a match.</li>
<li>Sport NFT cards that receive bonuses or losses based on wins/losses.</li>
<li>Artist NFT cards that change on a daily/monthly based.</li>
<li>NFTs affected by social media/real-life events.</li>
<li>NFTs that affect the real world, where a user can receive a physical item in exchange for NFT.</li>
<li>Kata NFTs were on the users’ progress the Kata NFT will change.</li>
<li>Geometric shape that change as price change</li>
</ul>
<p>The only related problem is about on-chain storage assets. Most NFTs do not store their assets directly on the blockchain because the cost of keeping them on-chain is expensive, as every action and every byte of information we hold on the blockchain has a fee. In addition, the Ethereum blockchain is designed to keep a record of transactions and not to serve as a data warehouse. Second, on-chain geometrical arts can quickly present, but for the more complex SVG files, it is possible to use <em>the bottom-top</em> approach. The idea is to have one zero-based image as a base and then add traits dynamically to the base image. Where will store only characteristics on-chain, and the NFT image is created dynamically. On-chain storage reduces external dependence, increasing reliability, durability, ownership, and decentralization. Keeping assets on-chain has excellent value. Users can rely on the same guarantees of immutability they use to secure property ownership, and the value of such art is more significant. When the asset is being followed on the Ethereum, we also want that asset to be placed on the Ethereum somehow.</p>

  <title>Detect NFT Wash Trading</title>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>With the monthly trading volume of the <strong>Non-Fungible Token (NFT)</strong> marketplace <a href="https://opensea.io">OpenSea</a> reaching 5 billion dollars in January 2022<sup>1</sup> it is clear that NFTs are gaining popularity and with that grows the importance of having a transparent trading activity.</p>
<p><strong>Wash trading</strong> is a form of market manipulation where a single entity or a group of colluding entities buy and sell the same asset with the goal of feeding the marketplace misleading information<sup>2</sup>. There are at least two possible benefits to wash trading, the first being that a single asset can be wash traded multiple times, continually increasing the price, thus making the asset appear more sought after than it actually is. This chain of wash trades is broken when an unsuspecting victim buys the asset. The second potential benefit is that the trading can be incentivized by the platform, with rewards being tied to the volume traded. Trading rewards can, at least for a limited time period, be higher than the fees, which makes this process worthwhile.</p>
<p>In the case of NFTs, wash trading is additionally enabled by the associated user anonymity. One single entity can control a large number of addresses without a way of reliably determining who is behind them. Those addresses, however, need to be somehow funded to make them usable, which leads to a money trail that can be followed to detect connections between them and to flag suspicious NFT trades.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Currently, only <a href="https://nansen.ai">Nansen</a>, a blockchain analytics platform that requires a paid subscription, offers a feature called “Wash Trading Filter” where users can see the metrics (volume, average price, etc.) for an NFT collection with and without the filter but cannot browse through the individual NFTs. Another drawback is that Nansen doesn’t disclose how the filter works, and so the question of why some trades were flagged remains.</p>
<p>Data on the blockchain is public, but it is hard to extract specific pieces of information from it. Detecting if a particular NFT was wash traded would require collecting every single trade that was made on all of the marketplaces and checking if the addresses involved in it are connected in some way. This data would need to be safely stored and effectively parsed to enable answering if any arbitrarily chosen NFT has been wash traded. The detection algorithm should also provide adequate reasoning on why a specific trade has been flagged. Developing and publicly disclosing the inner workings of such an algorithm would add more transparency to NFT trading, but it would inevitably lead to the creation of more intricate patterns that would not get caught if the algorithm is not regularly updated.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p><strong>The goals</strong> of this research are to :</p>
<ul>
<li>define what transaction patterns classify as a wash trade</li>
<li>develop ways of extracting the necessary information needed for the detection:
<ul>
<li>trades on two of the largest NFT marketplaces (OpenSea and <a href="https://looksrare.org/">LooksRare</a>)</li>
<li>Ether transfers for each of the accounts involved in the trade</li>
</ul></li>
<li>serve as a starting point for the creation of detection algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong> for accomplishing those goals consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>taking into account only Ethereum’s on-chain transactions when discussing ways a wash trade can be made</li>
<li>using <a href="https://docs.etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> and <a href="https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/">Alchemy</a> APIs to enable the data collection process</li>
<li>using Python programming language for the implementation part</li>
</ul>

<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<section id="wash-trading-patterns" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wash-trading-patterns">Wash Trading Patterns</h3>
<p>The explanation for the diagrams used in this paper is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>White circles with a letter inside them are addresses that are considered</li>
<li>Address can be connected with multiple lines</li>
<li>The line that has the <strong>NFT</strong> written on it signals that those two addresses were involved in an NFT trade</li>
<li>The line containing a number <strong>n</strong> on it signals that exists an Ether transfer trail between those addresses through <strong>n</strong> intermediaries
<ul>
<li>if <strong>n</strong> = 0 that is a direct transfer</li>
<li>if <strong>n</strong> = 1 there is a transfer trail involving one intermediary address</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lines with an arrow care about the direction of a transfer and point to the new owner’s address</li>
<li>Lines without an arrow do not care about the direction</li>
</ul>
<p>Shown on <em>Figure 1</em> there are two “meta-patterns” that this paper considers.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Figure 1 - Considered Meta-patterns</em></p>
</center>
<p>Meta-patterns can be expanded into specific patterns that care about the direction of those transfers (<em>Figure 2</em>). While some patterns may be more suspicious than others, all of them can be used for the purpose of wash trading. For example <em>pattern 2.2</em> can mean that after making a wash trade and selling the NFT to someone else, addresses <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> send all of their funds to address <strong>C</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p><em>Figure 2 - Expanded patterns</em></p>
</center>
<p>The reason that all of these patterns do not take the time order of transfers into account is that it doesn’t matter - they need to detect only the connections between addresses.</p>

<section id="collecting-and-parsing-of-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collecting-and-parsing-of-data">Collecting and Parsing of Data</h2>
<p>This research takes into account only trades of NFTs that follow the ERC721 standard. The same principles can be applied to the trades involving the ERC1155 standard, with the only difference being the collection and parsing of trades.</p>
<p>When an NFT trade is executed, the ERC721 compliant contracts emit a <strong>Transfer event</strong> that contains three fields: previous owner, new owner, and the token id. Using the combination of Etherscan and Alchemy APIs, it is possible to get all the events that were emitted by the transaction and to extract the needed event based on its topic along with all of its fields.</p>
<p>Not every Transfer event corresponds to a trade, so there needs to be an extra processing step that will eliminate all transfers that were not made through a marketplace. To do this, one needs to go through all of the marketplace’s contract’s transactions and select only those that have the right <strong>methodID</strong>.</p>
<p>After the seller’s (previous owner’s) and buyer’s (new owner’s) addresses are known, the last step is collecting and parsing of all of their transactions searching for Ether transfers and all the addresses they have interacted with - in this paper referred to as “associates”.</p>
</section>
<section id="wash-trading-detectors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wash-trading-detectors">Wash Trading Detectors</h2>
<p>Having a set of all of the buyer’s and seller’s associates enables the creation of <strong>Wash Trading Detectors (WTD)</strong>. This paper proposes and implements two basic algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WTD0</strong> that detects a direct transfer by checking if the seller’s address belongs to the set of buyer’s associates</li>
<li><strong>WTD1*</strong> that detects a set of common associates that are Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)</li>
</ul>
<p>*WTD1 is incomplete because the detected common associate can be a Centralized Exchange’s (CEX) address which would give a false positive. The only way to make the WTD1 fully functional is to manually keep a list of all the addresses that should be ignored.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Using the proposed ways of getting the data and reasoning on it, it is possible to extract suspicious wash trading patterns, flag those trades, and perform an analysis of the results. The code shown bellow is capable of getting the count of detected wash trades performed through a marketplace in a given block range :</p>

<section id="implications" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="implications">Implications</h3>
<p>The sample size of <strong>23</strong> is too small to discuss how the reported numbers relate to all of the NFT trades since the marketplace’s contract deployment. The code itself can, however, serve as a starting point for the development of a service capable of extracting the data from all of the NFT marketplaces since their creation. In that data lies the key to answering not only what trades are a wash trade but also who performed them, how many times was an address linked to a wash trade, whether one NFT has been wash traded multiple times, etc. Such a service would need to effectively manage its resources such as the collection of data and the computation needed in the detection - in the example above, set of associates is always computed from scratch (there is no storing of the result and checking if those values have already been computed). The full specification for the development of this service is out of the scope of this paper and should be a topic of a separate research.</p>
<section id="complex-patterns" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="complex-patterns">Complex Patterns</h4>
<p>Due to current non-negligible transaction fees on Ethereum and the fact that not many people are deeply looking into each trade, it is unlikely that there are complex patterns present in NFT wash trading. As the fees get lower and as the adoption grows, it’s almost certain that they will emerge. On the <em>Figure 3</em> is shown one pattern that could be used in the process of wash trading.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><em>Figure 3 - Complex pattern</em></p>
</center>
<p>There are two NFT wash trades present (marked by the black and blue colored arrows). The sequence of transfers is the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>A</strong> finances <strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong> through 3 and 2 intermediaries, respectively</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> finances <strong>D</strong> through 3 intermediaries</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> buys an NFT from some non-associated address</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> sells the NFT to <strong>C</strong></li>
<li><strong>D</strong> sends the funds to <strong>B</strong> through the same 3 intermediaries that were used before</li>
<li><strong>B</strong> finances <strong>E</strong> through 2 intermediaries</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> buys the NFT from <strong>C</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After the last step, <strong>E</strong> can sell the NFT to an unsuspecting victim. It is important to note that addresses used do not have to be discarded after each wash trade - i.e.&nbsp;<strong>B</strong> can be used just for routing of the funds. Furthermore, a malevolent entity can inflate the prices of not just a single NFT but for a complete collection, making it look like the collection is very popular, which attracts victims.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This research shows that it is possible to flag a specific trade as being a wash trade. The proposed algorithms can serve as a starting point in this process. To flag a specific NFT as being wash traded there would need to exist a list of all the trades of that NFT. This could be done via a service that would enable the users to browse the history of trades of any NFT on every marketplace and see all of the connections between the addresses that once owned it. If the service is built and popularized while keeping its inner workings public, the malevolent parties would try to evade detection which would lead to the need to constantly improve the algorithm.</p>

  <title>Explorative Research on Crypto Insurance - Current state, problems and possibilities of creating new products</title>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>In this paper we covered 5 of the main players in DeFi insurance market in order to determine the products offered, the problems with these products, the way the claims are handled and the possibilty of creating new insurance protocols. Initially we were not familiar with this field and the effort needed for creating these products, so we conducted this explorative research.</p>
<p>After the research we came to these conclusions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In creating these kind of products there needs to be significant effort both in developing and inital investment. Protocols covered utilize Advisory Boards of insurance experts in order to create their products.</li>
<li>State regulation is a big factor in insurance in order to protect the policyholders from malicious insurance offerers. This can be a problem, depending on the states’ attitude towards cryptocurrency.</li>
<li>Handling claims is often left to the community incentivizing just behavior by staking.</li>
<li>Collecting adequate capital initially is also one of the major problems.</li>
<li>Protocols with less staked pools have higher premiums in most cases which shows us that the risk assessment is usually hard to do with new protocols.</li>
<li>There is a limited cover capacity.</li>
<li>Usually there is no cross-chain coverage which limits the protection capability of DeFi protocols on other chains.</li>
<li>Lack of protection diversity: most products offered are limited when compared to the broad coverage of risk types in the traditional insurance market.</li>
<li>Insuring real world Events is almost non-existent. Etherisc offers 2 products using Oracles but our assumption is that there is still no market need for this kind of products thus there is not much movement in this direction. However utilizing Oracles in traditional products is an interesting thing and we think should be looked more into.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if You would like to go deeper to understand how these protocols work we recommend reading the entire paper.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this paper we will be exploring the current state and problems of the decentralized/crypto insurance field with an emphasis to exploring the types of insurance offered, how are claims assessed, processed and finally paid out to the insured in a decentralized way.</p>
<p>Before we go further in the paper we will be shortly covering some insurance basics with a goal of reader’s better understanding of this paper and insurance’s importance in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Considering Insurance is one of the oldest ways of dispersing risk over many individual units there could be many potential use cases for using this kind of mechanism in Web3, not just for the insurance of loss. Alas, this paper will be covering the current state and problems of Insurance and we will leave the potential cases for discussion.</p>
<p><strong>If you are already familiar with insurance terms you can continue to the Goals &amp; Methodology paragraph.</strong></p>
<section id="what-is-insurance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-insurance">What is Insurance?</h2>
<p>Insurance has a long history, there are claims that it was created around 2000 BC in Babylon, merchant receiving a loan paid the lender extra money in exchange for exemption of loan payment if the merchant’s shipment were stolen. Hovewer, the importance of insurance field cannot be presented without a mention of London’s Lloyd’s. In the 17th century, a London coffeehouse was a meeting place for people seeking marine cargo protection and people willing to take those risks in exchange for premium. The coffeeshop now is the world famous Lloyds. A sheet of cargo and ship information would be filled and the individuals who accepted that risk would sign with their names under it’s description.<sup>1</sup> That brings us to a first term in insurance <strong>underwriting</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Underwriting is risk accessment process to determine whether to accept or reject the risk we will come into contact with this term a lot in the later paragraphs.</p></li>
<li><p>As we previously mentioned the point of insurance is to <strong>transfer and share risks.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The individuals or companies that would like to transfer risk to other parties by paying a certain fee (<strong>premium</strong>) are called <strong>insured</strong>. The reason why the insured avoid the risk is because the loss is too volatile to bear.</p></li>
<li><p>The party that accepts such risks and and associated fee (<strong>premium</strong>) is the <strong>insurer</strong>. Insurers are not averse to exposing themselves to the same risks as insured because of something called <strong>pooling</strong> and the law of <strong>large numbers</strong>. The essence of pooling risk is to <strong>spread losses of the few over the entire group.</strong> The law of large numbers states that <strong>the greater the number of exposures the more closely will the actual results approach to the expected average value</strong></p></li>

<p>Insurance allows the insureds to “trade” the risk of loss for the certainty of smaller payments. As a result this ensured the stable cash flow since there are no extreme losses, and if they happen, they are covered by the insurance. As a result of this “stability” provided by insurance there is less need for governments assistance which saves public resources.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><em>Figure 1: The process of issuing insurance</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The application for insurance often starts with quoting process where the amount to be paid in premiums are estimated according to the risk the client would like to manage. After the application the underwriting process occurs.</li>
<li>Underwriter evaluates the information of the application and then accepts and then “fine-tunes” the policy using the rating tables from the actuaries. Actuaries calculate premiums, in DeFi, this is done in a different way, more words on that in the later paragraphs.</li>
<li>After the underwriter accepts the application the policy is issued.</li>
<li>If a loss occures the claims department examines the claim and asks the insured for the proof of loss before they pay the insured amount. The payment depends on the amount of damage suffered and the decision of the claim department.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big part of insurance also is its regulation. Insurance is one of the most actively regulated fields, especially after the financial crisis in 2008. The regulation aims to ensure solvency of the insurers. One of the ways the state regulates Insurance companies is limiting their investment tacticts and portfolio allocation , in other words they don’t let them invest in risky assets which is de-facto the norm in cryptocurrency investments. This is one of the first issues encountered if we were to cooporate with existing insurance companies or create our own protocol that is regulated.<sup>3</sup></p>

<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The goal of this research is to explore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The current state of DeFi Insurance and Insurance with cryptocurrency.</li>
<li>The process of applying, policy issuing and insurance claiming in a decentralized way of the main competitors in this market</li>
<li>The problems present with this kind of products.</li>
<li>Possibility of insuring material goods with cryptocurrency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Approach to this research will primarily be reading the whitepapers of covered protocols and documentation, discord discussions with staff and reading the reports of other researchers we find online.</p>
<p>Answers to the questions above will give us an insight into this field of DeFi and will provide us with better of understanding of insurance in general for creating potential products if we decide to go into that direction. Considering the effort needed to create this kind of products this short explorative research is conducted.</p>
<p>Approach to this will be explorative one as previously mentioned. We will start with presenting the main competitors in this field and we will analyze their proccesses. Extra attention will be paid to the biggest competitors. Afterwards the problems of these products with cryptocurrency will be presented.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-current-state-of-defi-insurance-and-insurance-with-cryptocurrency-and-insurance-processes">The current state of DeFi Insurance and Insurance with cryptocurrency and insurance processes</h2>
<p>When it comes to crypto-insurance with traditional insurers the market is non-existent, because of the regulation, lack of awareness and the lack of crypto adoption among general public. That’s why we will be covering DeFi insurance field.</p>
<p>DeFi Insurance refers to buying coverage against losses cause by events in Decentralized Finance. With various hacks and exploits over the years the need for insuring users from the results of these events emerged. Contrary to the layman’s belief DeFi Insurance field is big and growing with different protocols emerging in it. However only 2% of all DeFi value is insured at the moment.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Main protections offered is capital protection against protocol hack/exploit risk, smart contract failures or stablecoin crashes. The premium user pays for a cover depends on the type of the cover, insurance provider and the duration of the cover.</p>
<p>The Decentralized part in this type of Insurance is that anybody can act as a coverage provider, which supports the initial writers assumption. They become providers by locking up capital in a capital pool of the insurance protocol thus providing needed liquidity. As coverage providers they choose for which protocols or events they want to provide coverage, for example: If they are certain that a protocol is safe from exploits they will prefer providing liquidity to the pool that covers that event.</p>
<p>Another big part of DeFi Insurance is verifying claims. This is often done by the Insurance protocol’s community. Considering the nature of insurance and pooling of risk and collecting coverage from providers they are often assembled as DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). This means that governance token holders participate in verifying claims. There are several ways of doing that and we will be covering it in the next paragraph.</p>

<section id="nexus-mutual" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nexus-mutual">Nexus mutual</h3>
<p>Nexus mutual is an Ethereum-based platform that offers insurance products led by community management and financials. Nexus mutual is set up as a DAO. Nexus offers three kinds of products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection against failures in any protocol used by users yield bearing token (Ethereum only)</li>
<li>Protection against failures in the individual protocol user has funds in, on any chain, but not in other protocols it uses.</li>
<li>Protection against hacks and halted withdrawals on exchanges or custodial wallets<sup>5</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply put, Nexus cover protects against loss of funds, not loss of value, except in the Yield Token Cover. In the Yield Token Cover Nexus <em>may</em> pay a claim if:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the cover period the face value of the covered token and the market value of the covered token differ in price by more than 10% for a continuous period of four hours or more; and</li>
<li>The Covered Member contributes to the mutual, one unit of face value of the covered token in exchange for 0.90 units of cover amount they wish to claim; and</li>
<li>The Covered Member redeems their claim payment during the cover period or within 14 days of the cover period ending.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nexus does not provide Cover where the covered tokens and the cover amount are not denominated in the same refference currency. Nexus also doesn’t provide cover for any material goods loss.</p>
<p><strong>Claim assessing process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All Covered members for a particular covered token will be assessed together for each claim event; and</li>
<li>The face value of the covered token immediately prior to the claim event shall be set as part of the claims assessment process; and</li>
<li>Following a successful claim vote all Covered Members will be able to contribute their covered tokens and redeem their claim payment on a proportional basis up to the cover amount.<sup>6</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>We will not cover the other 2 products into great detail, as they are pretty straight forward. More info on them can be found here: https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/welcome/faq/cover-products</p>
<p>All protocols and custodial accounts can be covered by the platform provided that <strong>risk assesesors</strong> staked enough value against them. Risk Assessors (experienced auditors, capital providers) can stake value in the form of NXM token, thereby vouching for the security of the protocol/custodian and dropping the price of the cover. NXM can be unstaked at any time subject to a 30-day withdrawal period. When cover is subsequently sold on a protocol or custodian, Risk Assessors earn proportional rewards in NXM equivalent to 50% of the cover premium. If a claim is accepted and a payout occurs, Risk Assessors staked against the protocol/custodian will have their staked NXM burnt on a proportional basis to facilitate the payout of the cover amount. This may result in a Risk Assessor having some or all of their NXM staked against the protocol/custodian burnt to provide capital for the payout of the claim.</p>
<p>Cover becomes available through one of two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When Risk Assessors stake NXM against a protocol, custodian or cover product more cover is made available. The mutual places limits on the amount of cover to protect the mutual from being too exposed to any single risk. There are two limits a <strong>Specific Risk Limit</strong> and a <strong>Global Capacity Limit</strong>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Specific Risk limit</strong> means capacity on any particular risk is limited by the amount of staking on that risk. If there is no staking the mutual cannot offer any cover. Specific Risk limit is equal to : <strong>capacity factor x net_staked_NXM</strong> .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Global Capacity Limit</strong> is based on the financial resources of the Mutual and is there to ensure the mutual is not overly exposed to any particular risk, regardless of how much is staked. <strong>Global Capacity Limit = Minimum Capital Requirement In ETH (MCReth) x 20%</strong></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>As cover policies expire cover becomes available. User can check Nexus Tracker for info on cover expiry.<sup>7</sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Membership issue regarding privacy</strong></p>
<p>Membership in Nexus requires a one-off membership fee of 0.0020 ETH (~$5.50). However, to become a member users need to verify their identity following their Know Your Customer process. They also cannot accept members from 17 countries, Serbia included, thus limiting the usage of the mutual.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
<p>All deployed contracts of Nexus Mutual can be found here: https://api.nexusmutual.io/version-data/</p>
<p>All info regarding cover, staking and claims approvals/denies can be found here: https://nexustracker.io/</p>
<p><strong>How are Cover purchases taken care of by Nexus?</strong></p>
<p>Users specify which smart contract address they want cover for. They specify the cover amount , currency (ETH or DAI) and Cover Period. Quote will be generated and they need to make the transaction with Metamask. Users can currently pay with ETH, DAI or NXM (nexus mutual tokens). Cover Holders can submit a claim for material loss that occured within the cover period. They can also submit a claim up to 35 days after expiry. <strong>A loss that ocurs after cover policy is ended won’t be covered</strong></p>
<p><strong>How are claims taken care of?</strong></p>
<p>Claims are filed by submission. Members must provide cryptographic evidence of the loss (proof of loss) and their claim is later assessed by Claim Assessors by voting. Assessors are financially incentivised to take a longer-term view as they are required to lockup a stake. This stake is then burned if there is evidence of fradulent voting, which is addressed by Advisory Board. Advisory board consists of five members of founding team of the Nexus Mutual and insurance industry experts. They are said to have :</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical Expertise on Smart Contract Security and blockchain</li>
<li>Technical Expertise on Insurance and Mutuals</li>
<li>General Expertise</li>
</ul>
<p>Advisory board is there to provide techniqual guidance to the members of the mutual as well as to exercize the emergency functions if they are required.</p>
<p>This proposes a question: How do they keep the Advisory Board “in check” with Nexus’s decentralization principles?</p>
<p>Nexus does that by enabling members to kick-vote the Advisory Board members that they think are working maliciously. Board member can be replaced by another member if the membership base agrees. These proposals cannot be interfered with by the existing Advisory Board.</p>

<section id="bridge-mutual" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bridge-mutual">Bridge Mutual</h3>
<p>Bridge Mutual has a similar business model as Nexus Mutual (DAO model). They provide coverage for smart contracts, stablecoins and other services. Bridge allows users to purchase coverage, provide coverage in exchange for yield, vote on policy claims and their payouts. We will not go into great detail as there are various similarities with Nexus Mutual to avoid repeating ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>The main difference between Bridge and Nexus Mutual is that that Bridge doesn’t check customer’s ID and is available for residents all countries</strong></p>
<p>Any user on the platform can create any pool for any project as because the system is permissionless by design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial capital (USDT) must be put into the Project Coverage Pool by the user that is creating the pool.</li>
<li>That project can create incentives for coverage providers to provide coverage to their pool by depositing any number of Token into its designated Shield Mining pool which gets distributed to Coverage Providers alongside the typical yield.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coverage Provider examines the risk of providing Coverage Capital to the Project’s Coverage Pool. When they provide capital they are de-facto telling users that they are sure in the security and stability of the project. They recieve yield from the users purchasing policies and the BMI(Bridge Mutual) token staking. When coverage providers supply capital to the coverage pool they receive a token (bmi(project name)Cover) representing their share in the capital within this capital pool. Coverage providers can then stake those tokens in the bmiCover Staking Contract pool to get additional BMI rewards. They also recieve a BMINFT Bond that represent the amount of for example DAI staked in Cover Staking Contract pool. These NFT Bonds are tradable on any NFT marketplace. The purpose of these NFT bonds is to give the user a way out of their position without removing DAI from the ecosystem. When the Coverage Provider sells his NFT he also transfers the ownership of the staked bmiDAIx.</p>
<p>Policy Holder pays a premium for Coverage to protect against the Coverage Event that could affect the insured Project and cause them to lose funds. The total cost of the Premium is split : 80% to coverage 20% to the Reinsurance Pool. They can buy cover for minimum of 1 week and maximum of 52 weeks. Three factors determine the price of cover (premium):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The utilization ratio of the pool (ratio between cover bought and cover provided, pools that have higher utilization ratio are riskier and more expensive)</li>
<li>Duration of the cover</li>
<li>Amount of cover which user wants to buy</li>
</ol>
<p>The Reinsurance pool consists of protocol owned funds that are used to provide liquidity to Coverage Pools. The reinsurance pool is funded through 20% of all premiums paid as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The Capital Pool aggregates USDT from the Coverage Pools and provides additional revenue to the protocol. Capital Pool sends USDT to yield generating platforms they deem to have low risk. We coulnd’t find exactly what those platforms are. This is a similarity with classic insurance companies which are limited in what way they invest their funds.</p>
<p><strong>Proving a loss</strong></p>
<p>Policy holders should submit any or all of the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Transaction IDs proving that Policy Holder’s wallet deposited assets into the protocol and transaction IDs of the Coverable Event</li>
<li>Posts from Protocol team, or an auditing team confirming that there was an exploit and providing additional information</li>
<li>A description of the Coverable Event</li>
<li>If the address affected was not the same address that purchased coverage, any evidence that proves the Policy Holder is the bonafide owner of the address that suffered a Permanent Loss.</li>
</ol>
<p>They also need to deposit 1% of the claim’s value in BMI to prevent spam claims. If the claim is valid, USDT is issued to the Claimant. If a claim is denied they can try again by depositing 1% again.</p>
<p>A successful claim can only recieve up to the policy’s maximum coverable amount. If the DAO determines that the loss suffered was less then the maximum coverable amount, policy owners may recieve less funds. The DAO is incentivized to pay the claimant the exact amount that was lost.</p>
<p><strong>Voting process</strong></p>
<p>Votes for claim approval are anonymous and any user holding vBMI can vote. Voters can wote on multiple Claims before submitting them in a batch send. This is done to save time and gas. Only users that vote in the majority are rewarded with BMI for voting. Users that vote in the minority can lose “reputation” which decreases voting power. If there is a large diference in voting yes or no (80% to 20%) users that voted no will lose a portion of their stake.</p>

<section id="insureace.io" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="insureace.io">InsureAce.io</h3>
<p>InsurAce.io is a multi-chain mutual insurance protocol created in April 2021. It offers products that cover 100+ protocols, 3 CEX and 1 IDO platform. Currently they are depoloyed on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche. InsurAce hasn’t yet adopted the DAO governance mechanism, although they are working on it.</p>
<p>Current state of Insurace.io (Capital pool size, Active cover amount, Capital Ratios etc ) can be found here: https://app.insurace.io/Data/Insurance</p>
<p>This protocols has 4 unique selling propositions :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“0” Premium - Which means that the premiums are lower for their products. Their team designed portfolio-centric products to embrace risk diversification, developed models to optimize the cover cost. They did so by using advisors that are experts in the Insurance domain.</li>
<li>Enriched Product Line - InsurAce.io also offers products that covers non-Ethereum DeFi protocols.
<ol type="1">
<li>Types of protocols and smart contract systems covered:
<ol type="1">
<li>Lending Protocols</li>
<li>Decentralized Exchanges</li>
<li>Derivative (e.g.&nbsp;Synthetix, Nexus Mutual)</li>
<li>Asset (e.g.&nbsp;Badger, RenVM)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>SCR Mining - The participants earn $INSUR tokens by staking into the mining pool. The mutual capitals injected through staking will be managed with rigorous risk control models to adjust the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) dynamically and use the secured free capital for investment to control the mining speed accordingly.</li>
<li>InsurAce tries to combat the low investment returns. Nexus mutual offers capital return to their providers from the premiums paid by users which is low compared to the yield on Compound and Aave. This problem makes users prefer putting their funds elsewhere, instead of the Insurance Protocol. Insurace combats this with offering users:
<ol type="1">
<li>Option to invest directly in the investment product depending on their risk aversion</li>
<li>Option to stake in the mutual pool and get the investment carries and $INSUR tokens as rewards</li>
<li>Shares of the premium income</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>InsurAce is operates similarly like the traditional insurance company using the insurance arm and the investment arm.</p>
<p>“The insurance arm maintains reserve pools which maintain the solvency for claim coverage based on risk exposure. The investment arm maintains investment pools that generate carry to subsidize claims and attracts investors with risk appetite. The free capital in the insurance capital pool can be placed into the investment pool to gain a higher yield, while the insurance arm will protect the investment activities. Meanwhile, the investment arm’s yield will complement the premium on the insurance side and reduce the cover cost for customers.” ‘Whitepaper’<sup>8</sup></p>
<p><strong>Pricing model</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to before mentioned protocols they rely heavily on the value staked on individual protocols: the higher value staked the lower the premium will be priced. InsurAce tries to combat this with adopting the new actuary-based pricing model to mitigate this in order to assess the expected loss of insurance products fairly, reduce costs and enhance capability.</p>
<p>“The model’s main inputs are the number/amount of claims and number/amount of exposures in a given time period, which will be used for selecting and training two separate models - the frequency model and the severity model. Frequency modeling produces a model that calibrates the probability of a given number of losses occurring during a specific period, while severity modeling produces the distribution of loss amounts and sets the level of deductible and limit of the coverage amount.” These models are then combined to solve aggregate loss. After that the decided aggregate loss is incorporated into the risk factors of protocols and the premiums are then calculated. The model’s parameters rely on historical data to devise and validate. They plan on taking this further with new Machine Learning methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>Capital model</strong></p>
<p>InsurAce’s capital model refers to EIOPA’s Solvency II, this regime is used for insurance and reinsurance in the European Union. It sets requirements needed for insurance products in order to protect policyholdes and beneficiaries.</p>
<p>“Solvency II is an economic risk-based approach that should assess the”overall solvency” of insurance and reinsurance undertakings through quantitative and qualitative measures. Under Solvency II, the undertaking’s solvency requirements are determined based on their risk profiles and how such risks are managed, providing the right incentives for sound risk management practices and securing enhanced transparency.”</p>
<p>Solvency II has different tiers of which the SCR (Solvency Capital Requirement) and MCR (Minimum Capital Requirement) are the two most important ones.</p>
<p>“The SCR is the capital required to ensure that the insurance company will be able to meet its obligations over the next 12 months with a probability of at least 99.5%, while MCR represents the threshold to correspond to an 85% probability of adequacy over 12 months and is bound between 25% and 45% of the SCR. For supervisory purposes, the SCR and MCR can be regarded as”soft” and “hard” floors.”</p>
<p>InsurAce uses SCR to calculate the minimum requirement funds set aside to pay all the potential claims considering all quantifiable risks. SCR is calculated with the following inputs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All the active covers</li>
<li>All the outstanding claims</li>
<li>The potential incurred but not reported claims</li>
<li>The market currency shock risk</li>
<li>The non-life premium &amp; reserve, lapse and catastrophe risks</li>
<li>The potential operational risk</li>
</ol>
<p><code>SCR% = Capital Pool Size / SCR</code></p>
<p>A high ratio means the insurance company is financially strong with sufficient available funds to cover potential claims and other risks so the company is less likely to be insolvent . <strong>The lowest acceptable ratio is 100%.</strong></p>
<p>InsurAce also offers information of their Capital Efficiency ratio which shows the company’s current success in deploying capital.</p>
<p><code>CER% = Active Cover Amount / Capital Pool Size</code></p>
<p>A high ratio means the insurance company is increasing the productivity of its assets to generate income. Desired ratio is between 100% and 300%.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Assesment by InsurAce.io</strong></p>
<p>InsuraAce’s Advisory Board performs a preliminary risk assesment on the new protocols at first. InsurAce will also work with auditing firms if there is extra complexity or challenges. After that Advisory Board provides a report and rates the protocol 1 to 5. After they rate it protocol will go through the community risk assesment. Members who participate in the assesment get INSUR tokens as incentive.</p>

<p>This diagram shows us the whole system of claims Assesment in a clear way. The main difference is the inclusion of the Advisory board members which consists of various industry experts including the CTO of InsurAce.</p>
<p>“$INSUR token holders can stake the $INSUR tokens to become the community Claim Assessor. Claim Assessor will be entitled to the right to vote in each claim assessment and earn $INSUR tokens as reward if their votes match with the voting result. During each voting session, the more tokens the user stake, the more voting tickets they will get (* capped at 5% of the total votes), and the more rewards they will receive.”</p>

<section id="nsure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nsure">Nsure</h3>
<p>Nsure was targeted to be a platform for users to trade risks borrowing the operation model of previously mentioned Lloyds London. With Nsure information is transparent and users are allowed not only to be outsorcing risk but also to become risk takers, capital providers, governance actors and auditors of the system.</p>
<p>More data on Nsure performance can be found here: https://app.nsure.network/#/cover/my</p>
<p><strong>Product</strong></p>
<p>Nsure offers Smart contract cover like previously mentioned protocols. The coverage and exclusions are identical so we will not go into great detail. More info can be found at: https://docs.nsure.network/nsure-network/docs/nsure-smart-contract-protect-policy-wording</p>
<p><strong>Capital model</strong></p>
<p>Capital is sourced from capital mining, with return of Nsure tokens for the miners to ensure a continuous capital support to the underwriting. Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) is calculated based on the volume of each project and the correlation between them. A low MCR% below a pre-determined threshold will result into a lock of assets in capital pool, so as to protect the solvency the business.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing model</strong></p>
<p>Nsure uses a Dynamic Pricing Model to set the price. In this model capital supply and demand from the entire platform determines the price jointly similar to the pricing mechanism in the free market, by having Nsure tokens backing the policies bought. The price is self-adjustable to the movement of supply and demand, subject to the model, moderately stabilising the price change.</p>
<p><strong>Rating System</strong></p>
<p>Nsure uses its N-SCOSS rating system to quantify the code security of projects by assessing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>History and Team</li>
<li>Exposure</li>
<li>Audit</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
<li>Developer community</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Claim process</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/posts/https:/399601259-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fnsure-network%2F-MX6EZjd-IYguhPxsT3i%2F-MX6K9inCZbKlXukrmEm%2F0.png?generation=1617178176984217&amp;alt=media" style="height: 500px; width:700px;"></p>
<p><em>Figure 4: Nsure claim process</em></p>
<p>For each policy sold there is one chance of claim filling for free. If the first claim was rejected a claim assesment fee of 10% is requested before new assesment.</p>
<p>Policy holder must provide evidence of loss on the designated project within the insurance period. Proof of loss must include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Proof of ownership of affected account - After identifying his affected account, policyholder may prove his ownership over the account by signature or making a 0 amount payment to a specified address.</li>
<li>Evidence of loss - Policy holder should provide:
<ol type="1">
<li>the snapshot of the affected address’s balance at blocks before and after attack (to assist claim assessors quickly quantify the amount of lost</li>
<li>transaction of selling the damaged assets (loss is only recognised when it is realised)</li>
<li>description of the attack from project team or security specialist</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Claim assesment</strong></p>
<p>Nsure introduced a similar voting mechanism as previously mentioned protocols. Its features are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To be registered as a claim assessor candidate, user must deposit a considerable amount of Nsure token. At launch, the deposit is set at () Nsure token.</li>
<li>Claim assessors are randomly picked from registered candidate. For each claim, there will be 5 claim assessors.</li>
<li>As claim assessors’ reward is proportion to premium, users tend to register for larger size policy. To get each policy equal and fair tender, users do not know the premium of the policy at registration.</li>
<li>The token will be slashed if the claim assessor’s judgment is different from the majority.</li>
</ol>
<p>After claims assessors make a decision, policyholder and other Nsure token holders can challenge this decision. This will lead to a public vote for the final conclusion on the issue.</p>

<p>So far we have been covering only protocols that offer smart contracts protection. Etherisc tries to include material goods into the story. Etherisc is a protocol to collectively build insurance products. Common infrastructure, product templates and insurance license-as-a-service make a platform that allows anyone to create their own insurance products. The first product Etherisc offered was FlightDelay Insurance. Products currently licensed are: Crop Insurance and FlightDelay Insurance. Products currently in design: Hurricane Protection, Crypto Wallet Insurance, Collateral Protection for Crypto backed Loans, Social Insurance (death, heavy illness). They are also open for product requests. Users have the option to build their own insurance product, but more information about the user needs to be provided.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>They also launched a Joint Grant Program with Chainlink to accelerate the adoption of data-driven decentralized insurance products, so we think that special attention should be paid towards potential building with Etherisc.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p><strong>Etherisc Token</strong></p>
<p>DIP Tokens act as the native internal currency that is inseparable from the protocol and network of its users. DIP tokens are needed to earn transaction fees (% of insurance premiums or fixed cost), incentivize and reward platform users to bring risk to the network, build and maintain risk transfer products. The total supply of Etherisc Tokens is 1 Billion.</p>
<p>DIP tokens give users access to the Decentralized Insurance Platform. By staking DIP token, participants provide collateral (bond) to guarantee future performance, availability, and service levels. Staking also signals quality and reputation. As a result, participants can earn money monetizing their skills, software (for example risk models or UI/UX), risk capital, insurance licenses, claim processing, or regulatory compliance/reporting services.</p>
<p><strong>FlightDelay Insurance example from the Whitepaper - Launched on January 20 2022</strong></p>
<p>In their whitepaper’s FlightDelay Insurance product they use oraclize to obtain data from their data provider. Oraclize charges Etherisc for calling their contract. Etherisc incentivize Oraclize to provide their service correctly by :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the buyers market (market with many oracles) - Demanding of Oraclize to put some tokens in a staking contract which will then returns tokens if they deliver in time and forward the tokens to Etherisc in case they miss their obligations.</li>
<li>In the sellers market (market with only one or few oracles) - Oraclize will earn an additional profit, again by staking tokens in a “staking contract”, but with reversed roles: Etherisc will stake tokens, and Oraclize will earn these tokens if they deliver, and in case they don’t deliver, the tokens are returned to Etherisc.</li>
<li>Both options can be combined with both parties staking tokens from historical flight delay</li>
</ol>
<p>Their experience with the Flight Delay DApp confirmed that insurance applications need plenty of capital to be able to scale. But that entry barrier can be overcome with cryptographic tokens that enable highly customized economics. Their goal is to allow the tokenization of risks on the platform and to make them available on a global open-access marketplace.</p>
<p>In this kind of insurance the probability is calculated from historical flight data. They used flight delay initially as a POC because of low premiums assosciated with them and under normal circumstances flight dellays are well-aproximated by independent probability events. Etherisk leverages ChainLink data.</p>
<p>On January 20th 2022 Etherisc launched FlightDelay on Gnosis Chain Mainnet. It uses Chainlink Data Feeds to autonomously issue policies and execute payouts for travelers who experience flight delays or cancellations. The result of this is insurance policies that are quicker to settle, cheaper to provision thanks to decreases in human and technical overhead and more transparent given the blockchain backend.</p>
<p>FlightDelay is now available for passenger flights globally. The insurance policies are purchasable with USDC using the Gnosis Chain on Etherisc’s FlightDelay portal. More payment options are in the works.</p>
<p><strong>Participants in the Etherisc Protocol</strong></p>
<p>Participants in the protocol are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Customers - Customers can buy insurance using the token. For convenience, third parties can offer payment gateways and integrations which remove the necessity to own cryptocurrency from the end customer. Furthermore, participants can choose to offer insurance products in any native currency - be it a cryptocurrency, a token or a fiat currency. <strong>Use of token: Universal currency to buy insurance products.</strong></li>
<li>Risk model Providers and Actuaries - “Risk models are fundamental for any insurance product. The correctness of the model is precondition for the economic success of the product.Generally, because of the magnitude of value affected by errors and deviations in the model, a Risk Model Provider won’t take responsibility for the economic outcome of his model, but rather for his adherence to principles and established guidelines in his trade.” <strong>Use of token: Staking/Reward for providing or updating risk models</strong></li>
<li>Data providers and oracles - Currently, data is collected together with the application for an insurance, and the insurance company “owns” the data - even after the insurance contract is no longer valid. In a blockchain decentralized environment, the collection of data could be separated. Customers could get paid for voluntarily offering their data to a data pool, which in turn can sell this to interested parties, leaving the ownership of the data completely with the customer. This is an interesting take on handling events in the real world and the real world application of crypto insurance. <strong>Use of token: Reward for giving data. Reward for giving access to data pools. Staking / Reward for providing reliable oracles.</strong></li>
<li>Sales Agents - Sales agents are responsible for offering insurance products like in the traditional insurance. <strong>Use of token: Reward for distribution of products.</strong></li>
<li>Claim Agents - There are still many cases where automatic detection and processing the claims is not possible. Specialized and sometimes independent claims agents already exist that can be somewhat utilized e.g.&nbsp;in the area of car insurance, where they help insurers to process claims in shorter time. These claims agents can immediately use a decentralized platform, as soon as adequate products are available. <strong>Use of token: Reward for the provided service.</strong></li>
<li>License providers - Insurance in most countries depends on a proper license which can be difficult and costly to obtain. There is also a model where a license provider can act as an intermediary to regulators which is interesting if we are to build a new kind of insurance product. <strong>Use of tokens: Staking tokens to provide capital for a license provider, paying fees for licenses.</strong></li>
<li>Product managers - <strong>Use of token: Reward for service.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Etheriscs’ approach to crypto insurance is interesting but majority of their products are still in the works.Their first product FlightDelay Insurance was launched on January 10th 2022.<sup>11</sup></p>

</table>
<p>We went into detail on those protocols and have come to these conclusions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In creating these kind of products there needs to be significant effort both in developing and inital investment. Protocols covered utilize Advisory Boards of insurance experts in order to create their products.</li>
<li>State regulation is a big factor in insurance in order to protect the policyholders from malicious insurance offerers. This can be a problem, depending on the states’ attitude towards cryptocurrency.</li>
<li>Handling claims is often left to the community incentivizing just behavior by staking.</li>
<li>Collecting adequate capital initially is also one of the major problems.</li>
<li>Protocols with less staked pools have higher premiums in most cases which shows us that the risk assessment is usually hard to do with new protocols.</li>
<li>There is a limited cover capacity.</li>
<li>Usually there is no cross-chain coverage which limits the protection capability of DeFi protocols on other chains.</li>
<li>Lack of protection diversity: most products offered are limited when compared to the broad coverage of risk types in the traditional insurance market.</li>
<li>Insuring real world Events is almost non-existent. Etherisc offers 2 products using Oracles but our assumption is that there is still no market need for this kind of products thus there is not much movement in this direction. However utilizing Oracles in traditional products is an interesting thing and we think should be looked more into.</li>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Many companies sell goods with a business model based on donating some percent of their profit to charity. The problem is that some of these companies don’t transparently perform these donations. If, for example, the handmade wristwatch company claims that it donates 90 percent of earnings to the charity, the buyers can’t be sure whether they indeed donated the funds to charity or just bought a very expensive product. They can only believe the company itself. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for trust.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This paper tends to explain and show how the need for trust can be eliminated when it comes to donations and setting up business models in general. Idea is to have a platform that will allow you to set up a use case in which you want to allow users to buy a product from you where a specific percentage of the purchase will go to a different wallet(s).</p>
<ul>
<li>X% of purchase transparently goes to verified charity wallet</li>
<li>a split transaction between different co-creators or marketplace and author</li>
</ul>
<p>We can develop a fully transparent set of smart contracts and protocols on some general-purpose blockchain and introduce to sellers and customers a brand new way for selling goods and doing business in general.</p>
<p>Additionally, if there are too many different wallet recipients, the splitting can be done through merkle tree claim model.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<section id="goals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals">Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to make charity donations and spending transparent</li>
<li>Eliminate the need for trusting the brand, and provide customers a way to easily verify their spendings</li>
<li>Split input transaction to several different wallets by desired percentage</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="methodology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology">Methodology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Write a set of smart contracts in Solidity for this purpose.
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Portable to any EVM general purpose blockchain</li>
<li>Native support for cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Possibility for including ERC-20 tokens, as well</li>
<li>Tooling (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Lack of native percentage operator in Solidity, one need to decide up to which decimal the result is reliable</li>
<li>Transaction costs</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Integrate it with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bizzswap">Bizzswap</a>
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Out of the box solution for paying/swapping coins and tokens</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Third-party dependency</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Testing
<ul>
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Integration tests</li>
<li>End to end tests</li>
<li>Static analasys</li>
<li>Code coverage</li>
<li>Gas usage</li>
<li>Fuzz testing (optional)</li>
<li>Formal verification (optional)</li>
<li>Audit</li>
<li>Deployment to testnet</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The beauty of the end result is that anyone can port a frontend app to this decentralized protocol and incorporate it in their business models, already existing platforms, etc.</p>

<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>Transaction can be split among several parties in Solidity like this:</p>
<section id="step-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1">Step 1)</h3>
<p>Smart contract should have the ability to receive native coin or any other token. There is a need for a <code>receive()</code> or <code>fallback()</code> function, depends on the implementation of the smart contract.</p>
<p><code>receive()</code> is called if <code>msg.data</code> is empty, otherwise <code>fallback()</code> is called.</p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>    /**
    Which function is called, fallback() or receive()?

           send Ether
               |
         msg.data is empty?
              / \
            yes  no
            /     \
receive() exists?  fallback()
         /   \
        yes   no
        /      \
    receive()   fallback()
    */

    // Function to receive Ether. msg.data must be empty
    receive() external payable {}

    // Fallback function is called when msg.data is not empty
    fallback() external payable {}</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="step-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2">Step 2)</h3>
<p>Smart contract then needs to split the received amount among other wallets by defined percentage. Sending funds is trivial and we won’t focus on that. The most challenging part is proper ratio calculations in a language with no native support for decimal arithmetics.</p>
<p>In Solidity, one must assume that all numbers have 18 decimal precision. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 is 1000000000000000000,</li>
<li>0.5 is 500000000000000000, and</li>
<li>100 is 100000000000000000000</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there are no native language support for percentage arithmetics in Solidity, devs are using Basis Points as a unit of measurement equal to 1/100th of 1 percent. This metric is commonly used for loans and bonds to signify percentage changes or yield spreads in financial instruments, especially when the difference in material interest rates is less than one percent.</p>
<ul>
<li>0.01% = 1 BPS</li>
<li>0.05% = 5 BPS</li>
<li>0.1% = 10 BPS</li>
<li>0.5% = 50 BPS</li>
<li>1% = 100 BPS</li>
<li>10% = 1 000 BPS</li>
<li>100% = 10 000 BPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible implementation:</p>
<pre class="solidity"><code>    function calculateFee(uint256 _amount) public pure returns(uint256) {
        // for example 1.85% is fee

        return _amount * 185 / 10000;
    }</code></pre>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are no blockers for implementing this idea in Solidity. The tooling is stable, the math is not complex and can be handled by the language, and the blockchain technology itself is capable for storing this type of applications.</p>

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum both use elliptic-curve cryptography for generating keys and signing transactions. The algorithm they both use is called Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which represents a secure way of signing a message (a transaction for example) using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). This is a comparative analysis of BLS, Schnorr, and ECDSA signatures. The goal is to understand why are Ethereum and Bitcoin migrating from ECDSA, why BLS and Schnorr are superior to ECDSA and what are the key differences between them, how to use these signatures in the development and which Elliptic curves they are using and why.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The main goal of this paper is to provide a clear understanding of the differences between them and how to use them in future protocol development; to understand why is Bitcoin migrating from ECDSA to Schnorr and why Ethereum is migrating from ECDSA to BLS.</p>
<section id="quick-recap-ecdsa" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-recap-ecdsa">Quick recap: ECDSA</h2>
<p>Modern cryptography is founded on the idea that the key that you use to encrypt your data can be made public while the key that is used to to decrypt your data can be kept private. As such, these systems are known as public-key cryptographic systems.</p>
<p>ECDSA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm. Elliptic curve cryptography is a form of public key cryptography which is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. Used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Elliptic curve: secp256k1</p>
<section id="secp256k1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="secp256k1">secp256k1</h3>

<p>Private keys are generated as random 256 bits or 64 random hex characters or 32 random bytes. The public key is derived from the private key using ECDSA. Public key is a point on secp256k1 elliptic curve, generated by formula <code>K = k * G</code> where <code>K</code> is public key, <code>k</code> is private key, <code>G</code> is the constant point on secp256k1 elliptic curve and <code>*</code> is the multiplication operator on secp256k1 elliptic curve. There is no inverse, “<code>/</code>” operator, therefore the relationship between <code>k</code> and <code>K</code> is fixed, but can only be calculated in one direction, from <code>k</code> to <code>K</code>. A private key can be converted into a public key, but a public key cannot be converted back into a private key, because the math only works one way. The multiplication of <code>k * G</code> is equivalent to repeated addition, so <code>G + G + G + …​ + G</code>, repeated <code>k</code> times.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bls12-381">BLS12-381</h3>
<p>BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly elliptic curve construction that is optimal for zk-SNARKs at the 128-bit security level.</p>
<p>Barreto-Naehrig (BN) curves are a class of pairing-friendly elliptic curve constructions built over a base field <code>Fp</code> of order <code>r</code>, where <code>r≈p</code>. It is possible to construct a new BN curve that targets 128-bit security by selecting a curve closer to <code>p≈2^(384)</code>. However, the larger group order <code>r</code> impairs the performance of multi-exponentiation, fast fourier transforms and other cryptographic operations.</p>
<p>Barreto-Lynn-Scott (BLS) curves are a slightly older class of pairing-friendly curves which now appear to be more useful for targeting this security level. Current research suggests that with <code>p≈2^(384)</code>, and with an embedding degree of 12, these curves target the 128-bit security level.</p>

<section id="private-and-public-keys-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="private-and-public-keys-1">Private and public keys</h3>
<p>The private/secret key (to be used for signing) is just a randomly chosen number between <code>1</code> and <code>r−1</code> inclusive. We’ll call it <code>pk</code>.</p>
<p>The corresponding public key is <code>P=[pk]g1</code>, where <code>g1</code> is the chosen generator of <code>G1</code>. That is, <code>g1</code> multiplied by <code>pk</code>, which is <code>g1</code> added to itself <code>pk</code> times.</p>
<p>The discrete logarithm problem means that it is unfeasible to recover <code>pk</code> given the public key <code>P</code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="signing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="signing">Signing</h3>
<p>One can sign the message by calculating the signature <code>σ=[pk]H(m)</code>. That is, by multiplying the hash point by our secret key. But what is <code>H</code>?</p>
<p>To calculate a digital signature over a message, we first need to transform an arbitrary message (byte string) to a point on the <code>G2</code> curve. The initial implementation in Eth2 was “hash-and-check”:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Hash your message to an integer modulo <code>q</code></li>
<li>Check if there is a point on the curve with this <code>x</code>-coordinate. If not, add one and repeat</li>
<li>Once you have a point on the curve multiply it by the <code>G2</code> cofactor to convert it into a point in <code>G2</code>.</li>
</ol>

<section id="aggregation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aggregation">Aggregation</h3>
<p>A really neat property of BLS signatures is that they can be aggregated, so that we need only two pairings to verify a single message signed by <code>n</code> parties, or <code>n - 1</code> pairings to verify <code>n</code> different messages signed by <code>n</code> parties, rather than <code>2n</code> pairings you might naively expect to need. Pairings are expensive to compute, so this is very attractive.</p>
<p>To aggregate signatures we just have to add up the <code>G2</code> points they correspond to: <code>σagg=σ1+σ2+...+σn</code>. We also aggregate the corresponding <code>G1</code> public key points <code>Pagg=P1+P2+...+Pn</code>.</p>
<p>Now the magic of pairings means that we can just verify that <code>e(g1,σagg)=e(Pagg,H(m))</code> to verify all the signatures together with just two pairings.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="schnorr">Schnorr</h2>
<p>Schnorr signatures are generated slightly differently than ECDSA. Instead of two scalars <code>(r,s)</code> we use a point <code>R</code> and a scalar <code>s</code>. Similar to ECDSA, <code>R</code> is a random point on elliptic curve <code>(R = k×G)</code>. Second part of the signature is calculated slightly differently: <code>s = k + hash(P,R,m) ⋅ pk</code>. Here <code>pk</code> is your private key, <code>P = pk×G</code> is your public key, <code>m</code> is the message. Then one can verify this signature by checking that <code>s×G = R + hash(P,R,m)×P</code>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p></p><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This equation is linear, so equations can be added and subtracted with each other and still stay valid. This brings us to several nice features of Schnorr signatures that we can use.</p>
<section id="batch-validation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="batch-validation">Batch validation</h3>
<p>To verify a block in Bitcoin blockchain we need to make sure that all signatures in the block are valid. If one of them is not valid we don’t care which one - we just reject the whole block and that’s it.</p>
<p>With ECDSA every signature has to be verified separately. Meaning that if we have 1000 signatures in the block we will need to compute 1000 inversions and 2000 point multiplications. In total ~3000 heavy operations.</p>
<p>With Schnorr signatures we can add up all the signature verification equations and save some computational power. In total for a block with 1000 transactions we need to verify that</p>
<pre><code>(s1+s2+…+s1000)×G=(R1+…+R1000)+(hash(P1,R1,m1)×P1+ hash(P2,R2,m2)×P2+…+hash(P1000,R1000,m1000)×P1000)</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a bunch of point additions (almost free in sense of computational power) and 1001 point multiplication. This is already a factor of 3 improvement - we need to compute roughly one heavy operation per signature.</p>

<section id="key-aggregation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-aggregation">Key aggregation</h3>
<p>We want to keep our bitcoins safe, so we might want to use at least two different private keys to control bitcoins. One we will use on a laptop or a phone and another one - on a hardware wallet / cold wallet. So when one of them is compromised we still have control over our bitcoins.</p>
<p>Currently it is implemented via 2-of-2 multisig script. This requires two separate signatures to be included in the transaction.</p>
<p>With Schnorr signatures we can use a pair of private keys <code>(pk1,pk2)</code> and generate a shared signature corresponding to a shared public key <code>P=P1+P2=pk1×G+pk2×G</code>. To generate this signature we need to choose a random number on every device <code>(k1,k2)</code>, generate a random point <code>Ri=ki×G</code>, add them up to calculate a common <code>hash(P,R1+R2,m)</code> and then get <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> from every device <code>(si = ki + hash(P,R,m) ⋅ pki)</code>. Then we can add up these signatures and use a pair <code>(R, s) = (R1+R2, s1+s2)</code> as our signature for shared public key <code>P</code>. No one else won’t be able to say if it is an aggregated signature or not - it looks exactly the same as a normal Schnorr signature.</p>

<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>A major reason to use this new stack is that it admits efficient aggregation of many signatures into one signature which directly contributes to the scalability of ETH2.0’s security. With this transition, ECDSA signatures aren’t enough anymore as the number of signatures to verify was too big and would take too long on the average machine.</p>
<p>ETH 2.0 definies 64 committees for every block and each committee can have as many as 2048 validators, with each epoch consisting of 32 blocks. Under normal ECDSA that means 131,072 (64*2048) signatures for every block (12 sec), and 4,194,304 for every epoch (32 blocks). This means that an epoch’s worth of signatures would be 33.6 megabytes which comes to ~7.6 gigabytes per day. In this case, all of the false claims about the ETH 1.0 state-size reaching 1TB back in 2018 would be true in ETH 2.0’s case in fewer than 133 days (based on signatures alone). If every node in the network will need to verify each signature it becomes infeasible to build a scalable, sharded, blockchain.</p>
<p>As a solution to the above, signature aggregation was considered. Technically it will mean that many signatures could be verified in a batch, significantly shortening the time and resources required. ETH 2.0 makes use of the BLS signatures - a signature scheme defined over several elliptic curves that is friendly to aggregation. On the specific curve chosen, signatures are 96 bytes each. If Alice produces signature A, and Bob’s signature is B on the same data, then both Alice’s and Bob’s signatures can be stored and checked together by only storing C = A + B. By using signature aggregation, only 1 signature needs to be stored and checked for the entire committee. This reduces the storage requirements to less than 2 megabytes per day.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It will be interesting to see how blockchain clients will implement these new changes and how efficient will they be because we already concluded from the paper that the reason for switching from ECDSA is justified. We should monitor also the Bitcoin timeframe to be able to disscus more about Schnoor signatures implementation.</p>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Organisations may include non-founder members with specific roles (treasurer, secretary, board members…) with higher permission levels, compared to the regular members. Members that have permission levels which include control over organisation finances represent a high risk for the organisation as there is a high risk of losing money if malicious members perform illegal transfers. That problem is especially present in the world of cryptocurrency where transfers cannot be revoked, once transaction is executed there is no rollback. The use of multisig might be an obvious solution, but the high overhead cost of writting multiple signatures on blockchain, even if the transaction is valid, may not be acceptable in many situations where there is a high frequency of transactions.</p>
<p>This research proposes a solution for this problem, restricted to the world of crypto-financial transactions, by introducing a rotating token which guarantees randomised selection of members that would be granted specified roles over fixed period of time while allowing blockchain money-transferring transactions to be executed only by the members that are holding the token. For improved prevention of unwanted transactions, the transactions may be disputed before their execution, which allows higher control over money transfers and enables improved protection of organisation funds. All transactions are transparent to all approved members, which adds extra layer of transparency over the entire organisation budget.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Money transfer transactions are the essential parts of any organisation. Protection of organisation finances and prevention of malicious transactions is one of the top priorities. There is usually one, or a few people that are responsible for all money transfers in the organisation and are often the only members that are actually aware of those transfers. Malicious member with access to organisation funds may use the opportunity to leak money from the organisation for the causes that are against the organisation rules or even against the law. Board members of the organisation are ofter not aware of those malicious activities as the members that perform those transaction also prepare financial reports, hiding their tracks. An example would be a fake invoice representing payment for the fictive service that actually represents money laundering. Even invoice payments for the regular services may be modified with highly increased price.</p>
<p>Current mechanisms for controlling financial transactions in smaller organisations basically do no exist as every lost cent is easily trackable when dealing with smaller amounts of money. When dealing with large number of transactions and bigger funds, the situation is not that clear. Bigger organisations specify budgets for certain topics, restricting the maximum amount spent on specific topic, therefore defining the upper limit on transaction fraud potential [1]. Those budgets are not small, Microsoft Corporation spent more than 20 billion USD on sales and marketing in 2021 [2]. There is a big potential for hiding malicious transactions.</p>
<p>Choosing members that would be granted access to funds is currently solved in two ways: - Hiring accounting department [3]. In this setup, the employees are hired for the longer period of time, sharing the responsibility with each other and the head of the department. - Electing treasurer [4]. In this setup, the treasurer role can be assigned to different members, often by voting. The job of the treasurer is a person responsible for observing the accountant department, but in smaller organisation he is often the only person dedicated to manage and observe financial flows. The issue appears when the malicious clique tampers the voting and forces the election of a certain trusted member as long as they all benefit from it. There is also the case where the treasurer role is assigned once and never changed, assuming his honest work.</p>
<p>To prevent the problem, it is important to understand its cause. Newly granted members with access to organisation funds are often working by the book, scared of possible consequences when caught performing a malicious activity. As the time goes by, their actions are not carefully observed and their position in the organisation becomes stable. At that point, the risk of malicious transactions becomes higher as the actors are not observed and there was enough time to form a clique with other members [5,6]. To quote Margaret Murray: “Governments are like underwear. They start smelling pretty bad if you don’t change them once in a while.” The same goes with any position of power, even if that power includes just access to finances.</p>
<p>It seems that there are two main problems, unbiased change of authorisation and transparent transaction control.</p>
<p>Crypto-world introduced multisig wallets for improved safety. The problem with this approach is that it introduces costs to multiple members for executing one transaction even if that transaction is not malicious. The better approach would be a procedure that would add extra cost only to prevent malicious transactions, thus saving money when the transactions are not malicious.</p>
<p>Unbiased selection of participants to perform certain actions is demonstrated in certain Blockchains where validator nodes are selected in Round robin manner. Round robin approach may not be adequate for selecting treasurers as it is predictable and assumes that next treasurer will be available to accept the role. In general, unbiased selection should be incorporated wherever there is a high risk involved with knowing the choice in advance or where all choices should be equaly probable. Such cases include distributing role, data or duties to randomly selected entities, selection of randomly generated teams (such as jury selection) and similar.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The main goal of this research was to find a solution for having unbiased selection of personnel with access to finances as well as transaction control. The way to get to the solution was to present first all the requirements and restrictions.</p>
<p>The transactions that are focus of this research are blockchain transactions. This research will focus on Ethereum money-transferring transactions so the base element of the solutions would be Ethereum smart contract, for this research named ROTOKEN. ROTOKEN smart contract includes NFT token and wallet. The wallet is controlled only by the owner of the NFT.</p>
<p>All listed members of the organisation should be automatically whitelisted, meaning that all members should be able to get selected for special roles involving access to finances. This is naturally enforced as the salary payments are also transactions from organisation funds and therefore controlled by the ROTOKEN smart contract.</p>
<p>Unbiased selection can only be performed using unbiased probability distribution over the members that are applying for the position. The selection needs to take into account that next selected member can’t be the same as the previous one. Random selection on blockchain is a tricky part as it relies on values that can be predicted in advance. One of the sources of pseudo-randomness is the block hash, as it is a result of SHA3 function. However, the value is predictable by the miners and it can be tampered so it should not be used as a source of randomness. Another approach is using verifiable random functions such as Chainlink VRF. This might be costly but it is a good solution. This research also proposes another, possibly cheaper approach. Selecting the latest transaction hashes of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> wallets outside of the organisation ,with the most frequent transactions, and hashing them all together may be a good source of randomness as the main problem with predictable randomness from block hash is the ability of the miner to reorder transactions until the desired hash is achieved. By selecting transaction hashes instead of blocks, the only way to tamper with the randomness is to selectively mine transactions which leaves much less room for tampered combinations and transaction hashes are close to random as they are influenced by many changing variables.</p>
<p>Selection of new members with special roles should happen regularly in fixed intervals. As transaction of changing the role needs to be executed on blockchain, it is required that transaction is explicitly invoked. To incentivise regular changes, organisation funds would be blocked for transactions until the role is changed. Role change should not be allowed during before the end of current member’s term unless it is invoked by the current member. The role transfer to a new member is done by transferring ROTOKEN NFT.</p>
<p>Transaction that is submitted on blockchain can’t be revoked. The only way to prevent transaction execution is to prevent its submission. Proposed solution includes two step execution. The first step is transaction announcement, which should be executed on smart contract and contain details about target wallet and the amount being sent. The second step is transaction execution, which submits pending transaction to blockchain for execution. Between two steps, certain period of time should be left for disputes. If the dispute is initiated by enough participants the transaction will be canceled, where enough should be &gt;51% or &gt;2/3, but the exact limit would be configurable value.</p>
<p>To disincentivise submission of malicious transactions, that would eventually probably be disputed but also add extra cost for disputing, submitter should be penalised. For a member to loose money it is required that the member has the money in first place, so the safest way to ensure successful penalisation is to include staking. The money staked by the submitter would be lost in case of successful dispute.</p>
<p>Lost staked money needs to change ownership. If the money is sent to disputers, there would exist an incentive for members to dispute every transaction and earn money. To prevent this behaviour, the proposed solutions is transferring money to the organisation wallet. This solution may seem problematic and unnatural but there is an explanation for that. One way to look at staking is to take existing money out of the pocket. The other way is to take money “from the future”, meaning that member may have dedicated annual fond which is used to issue monthly payments as salary and may also be perceived as staked money. In this case, the penalisation would assume reduction of the future salary which technically is returning money back to the organisation. To further disincentivise disputes from the side of the organisation executives, disputed transaction, defined by the receiver’s address and the amount of money to be transferred, blocks further transfers to receiver’s address for certain amount of time. If the disputed transaction was indeed malicious, this mechanism will block further transactions to that address, preventing new attempts. If the transaction was falsely disputed and the receiver is a proper receiver of organisation’s money, by preventing the transaction and blocking the transfer to the proper receiver, the behaviour directly disrupts regular functioning of the organisation.</p>

<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>ROTOKEN smart contract should follow modifier ERC-721 smart contract. Token transfer should be possible only by internal call and the token should be transferred to randomly selected whitelisted member. Additionally, the smart contract should include: - list of whitelisted members, with getters and setters - list of transactions with statuses - dispute function - transaction announcement and execution functions - ownership change function, which would internally call transfer function</p>
<p>Proposed ROTOKEN smart contract interface:</p>
<pre><code>interface ROTOKEN {
    // + ...ERC-721 interface

    Enum { PENDING, DISPUTED, CANCELED, FAILED, EXECUTED } transactionStatus
    struct (
        transactionStatus status,
        address currentTokenOwner
        address receiver,
        uint256 amount,
    ) transactionData;

    mapping(transactionId =&gt; transactionData) public transactions
    address[] whitelistedMembers;

    event TransactionStatusChanged(uint256 indexed transactionId, transactionStatus status)

    function announceTransaction(address receiver, uint256 amount) public returns(uint256 transactionId);
    function executeTransaction(uint256 transactionId) public;
    function dispute(uint256 transactionId) public;
    function changeOwnership();
}</code></pre>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>ROTOKEN smart contract proposes solutions for unbiased selection of members for granting control over organisation funds and incentive based transaction control. Minimal additional operating costs required for essential control are added, on top of regular transaction costs. The smart contact extends ERC-721 interface with certain modifications and extensions which makes ROTOKEN NFT compatible for integration with the existing systems where the ERC-721 tokens are used. Those systems may use the information about the ownership of the ROTOKEN to grant the owners additional privileges, like document signing, voting etc. Next steps include market evaluation, PoC implementation and detailed operating cost estimation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>When looking to build dApps that utilize decentralized storage Filecoin seems like the best option even with its flaws like : absent proof of deletion for the client, absent encryption, impossible modifying of the stored data and the durability problem of Filecoin’s Proof of Replication. This research gives an overview of competitors in decentralized storage solution field with a focus on Filecoin protocol. It also shows how its competitor Storj differs from Filecoin and the current grant opportunities for potential building on it. Considering the results of the research Filecoin seems to be the best option considering the popularity and the size of its ecosystem. Currently there is no interest for building on and with Filecoin and this is a purely explorative work without experiments, in order to test the researcher’s methodology and the approach to research. However, it proposes a question about a potential way of improving Filecoin, or creating both safer protocol for the user and cheaper for the storage miners.</p>

<p>The aim of this research is to explore Filecoin protocol and show its fallacies as much as writer is possible with a goal of inspiring building applications that utilize Filecoin, new protocols or improving Filecoin via building for it. The paper will compile the list of all fallacies and possibilities for improvement for Filecoin, opportunities for building on it, and the current state of decentralized storage market mainly comparing Storj and Filecoin.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Unlike a centralized server operated by a single company, decentralized storage systems consist of a peer-to-peer network of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data. The platforms can store any data sent by the user, with some platforms more focusing on encryption. There is no official data disclosing the types of data stored. This research will be covering contract-based persistence platforms with a focus on Filecoin.</p>
<p>Contract-based persistence means that data cannot be replicated by every node and stored forever, and instead must be upkept with contract agreements. These are agreements made with multiple nodes that have promised to hold a piece of data for a period of time. They must be refunded or renewed whenever they run out to keep the data persisted. Platforms with contract-based persistence currently present on the market are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Filecoin</p></li>
<li><p>Skynet</p></li>
<li><p>Storj</p></li>
<li><p>0Chain</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Filecoin</strong> is a peer-to-peer network that stores files with built in economic incentives to ensure files are stored reliably over time. Users pay to store their files on storage providers. Storage providers are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored the files correctly over time. Available storage and the price of it is not controlled by any company. Anyone who wants to store their files or get paid for storing other users files can join Filecoin is written in its documentation, but is that really the case? It will be further explored in later sections. Filecoin’s native currency is FIL. Storage providers earn units of FIL for storing user’s data. Its blockchain records transactions along with proofs from storage providers that they are storing files correctly.</p>
<p>Currently Filecoin stores over <strong>40.0453 PiB</strong> of users data over <strong>1,848,292</strong> deals.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>When users want to store their files on Filecoin they use terminal or different guis that have been built by developers to choose between cost, redundancy and speed and they select the storage provider whose storage offer is best suited for their needs. Applications that implement filecoin negotiate storage with storage providers. There is no need for different API for each provider.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>“While interacting with IPFS does not require using Filecoin, all Filecoin nodes are IPFS nodes under the hood, and (with some manual configuration) can connect to and fetch IPLD-formatted data from other IPFS nodes using libp2p. However, Filecoin nodes don’t join or participate in the public IPFS DHT. IPFS alone does not include a built-in mechanism to incentivize the storage of data for other people. This is the challenge Filecoin aims to solve. Filecoin is built on IPFS to create a distributed storage marketplace for long-term storage.”<sup>3</sup></p>

<section id="filecoins-proof-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="filecoins-proof-system">Filecoin’s Proof System</h2>
<p>Filecoin uses Proof of Replication (PoRep) and Proof of Spacetime (poSt).</p>
<p>In a Proof of Replication, a storage miner proves that they are storing a physically unique copy, or replica, of the data. Proof of Replication happens just once, at the time the data is first stored by the miner. As the storage miner receives each piece of client data they place it into a sector, fundamental unit of storage in Filecoin. Sectors can contain pieces from multiple deals and clients. Steps in PoRep: ### Proof of Replication 1. <strong>Filling sectors and generating the Commd</strong></p>
<p>Once a sector is full a Commitment of Data (CommD) is created, representing the root node of all the piece CIDs contained in the sector.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Sealing sectors and producing the Commitment of Replication</strong></p>
<p>Sector data is encoded through a sequence of graph and hashing processes to create a unique replica. The root hash of the merkle tree of the resulting replica is called CommRLast. CommRLast is then hashed together with the CommC(another merkle root output from PoRep). This generates the CommR (Commitment of Replication) which is then recorded on Filecoin’s Blockchain. CommR, last is saved privately by the miner for future use in Proof of Spacetime but is not saved to the chain.</p>
<p>Encoding process is slow and computationally heavy. <strong>Filecoin doesn’t provide encryption by default so users must encrypt data before adding it to the Filecoin network.</strong> This is the first issue encountered with Filecoin : <strong>Filecoin is optimized for public data and doesn’t yet support access controls.</strong></p>
<p>The CommR offers clients the proof that the miner is storing a physically unique copy of the client’s data. If a client stores the same data with multiple storage miners, or makes multiple storage deals for the same data with the same miner, each deal will yield a different CommR. The sealing process also compresses the Proof of Replication using zk-SNARKs to keep the chain smaller so that it can be stored by all members of the Filecoin network for verification purposes.</p>
<p>Unlike PoRep which is run once to prove that a miner stored a physically unique copy of the data at the time the sector was sealed. PoSt is run repeteadly to prove that the miners are continuing to dedicate storage space to that same data over time.<sup>4</sup> ### Proof of Spacetime PoSt builds on several elements created during PoRep: the replica, the private CommRLast and public Commr. PoSt then selects some leaf nodes of the encoded replica and runs merkle inclusion proofs on them to prove that the miner has the specific bytes that indicate that he still holds the clients data. The miner then uses the privately stored CommRLast to prove that they know of a root for the replica which both agrees with the inclusion proofs and can be used to derive the CommR. As the final step PoSt compresses these proofs into a zk-Snark.</p>
<p>If the miners fail the Proof of Spacetime at any point they will lose their staked collateral. Aside for this fine, there is no other incentive to keep the miners storing the data. That becomes a problem if client’s storing private data or data of great significance.<sup>5</sup></p></li>

<section id="critique-from-the-users-perspective" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="critique-from-the-users-perspective">Critique From the users perspective:</h3>
<p>As of today the price of 1 Filecoin token (FIL) is $22.05. <strong>The users can store a gigabyte of data for as little as 0.0000006157315278020465 FIL (0.01% the cost of Amazon S3) which means the user can store 100GB of data for $0.00135.</strong><sup>6</sup> From the price perspective the upside of Filecoin is it’s cheap storage but there are various downsides such as:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Accesibility: if the user is not tech-savvy there is a big barrier to entry even with GUIs currently available. They are often not simple to install and it is hard to get them to work. Hovewer there are various Apps that make that somewhat easier like ChainSafe Files and Web3.Storage.When it comes to being a storage miner there minimal needs for hardware are:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>8+ core CPU</p></li>
<li><p>128 GiB of RAM atleast</p></li>
<li><p>A strong GPU for SNARK computations</p></li>
<li><p>1TiB NVMe-based disk space for cache storage is recommended</p>
<p>This data shows that there needs to be a significant investment on storage miners part which is nothing out of the ordinary but significantly reduces the accessibility to the average person, ofcourse assuming the person wants to be a storage miner.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>As the price of FIL tokens fluctuate the price of storage fluctuates as well. There is also a risk if any extra FIL is left in the customers wallet after the storage contract then token could potentially drop/rise in value, not to mention the fees of converting fiat into cryptocurrency.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no built in encryption. Users need to encrypt their data on their own. Encryption/decryption of files cost compute resources (RAM, CPU), and therefore money. Most end users would prefer the implementation of this functionality to be handled, optionally, by the Filecoin web, cli or desktop client software they choose to make use of. This problem is seemingly taken care of with apps like ChainSafe Files.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>ChainSafe Files is an online platform to store, view, and share files. Its main focus is data privacy of the users and self-reliance. When it comes to self-reliance ChainSafe Files makes sure that the users can access the stored files even if the Files platform becomes unavailable. It also offers authentication flow using a decentralized login provider called tKey, by Torus. tKey is a private key generator that can link keys to social accounts among other functions. The Files’ backend is built on top of ChainSafe Storage, and any file that is uploaded to Files is also pinned by a node on its infrastructure (each file has an CID) thus making the data retrieval possible even in the case of ChainSafe files app outage. In the case of retrieval users still have to decrypt the data, since all the data stored by ChainSafe Files is encrypted by default. ‘ChainSafe Files - Decentralized Cloud Storage’<sup>8</sup></p></li>
<li><p>If the storage provider doesn’t respect his end of the deal he will be penalized and lose his staked FIL. Unless negotiating a great number of deals for the same data and storing a lot of copies in Filecoin, there is no guarantee that the data will be safely stored. These deals for the same data increase the cost of the service if the user wants to have somewhat durable data. Filecoin tries to mittigate this by having storage miners put 100+ FIL in collateral which also lowers the accessibility to the average person to become a storage miner. Currently most of the storage miners are located in China.</p></li>
<li><p>Filecoin storage is cold storage. There is no way to modify data. If the user needs to change data , new data must be written.<sup>9</sup></p></li>
<li><p>If the user issues a deletion command there is no guarantee that the client performs the operation. There is no way yet to Construct a formal Proof of Deletion.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="the-issue-with-replication-and-filecoin" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-issue-with-replication-and-filecoin">The issue with Replication and Filecoin</h3>
<p>When decentralized storage network is utilized any storage node could go offline thus the stored data would be at risk of getting lost. To achieve a somewhat reliable storage many decentralized providers use replication, which means the only way to keep the users data reliably besides penalizing storage miners is to store multiple copies of it. Replication is not good for the network expansion factor. If Filecoin wants more durability for its data it needs more copies. For every increase of durability (storing or repairing the data) another multiple of the data size in bandwith is needed. Eg. If the durability level requires a replication strategy that makes 10 copies of the data this yields and expansion factor of 1000%. This data needs to be stored on the network, using bandwith in the process. The more replication the bigger the bandwith usage. Hovewer, if the node goes offline , only one of the storage nodes is needed to bring a new replacement node in, which again means that the 100% of the replicated data must be transferred. Excessive expansion factors produce an inefficient allocation of resources.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Another issue with replication is churn (nodes joining and leaving the network). Quoting Patrick Gerbes and John Gleeson: “Using replication in a high-churn environment is not only impractical, but inevitably doomed to fail. Distributed storage systems have mechanisms to repair data by replacing the pieces that become unavailable due to node churn. However, in distributed cloud storage systems, file repair incurs a cost for the bandwidth utilized during the repair process. Regardless of whether file pieces are simply replicated, or whether erasure coding is used to recreate missing pieces, the file repair process requires pieces to be downloaded from available nodes and uploaded to other uncorrelated and available nodes.”<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Currently the circulating supply of FIL token is 162,302,978.00 FIL. The potential circulating FIL could reach 1.977 Billion tokens if the network hits a Yottabyte of storage capacity in under 20 years which is brave considering the current data stored in data centers today is less then a Zettabyte and a Yottabite is 1000 times larger. The 770 Million of which is for baseline minting.</p>
<p>330 million FIL tokens are released on a 6 year half-life based on time. A 6 year half-life means that 97% of these tokens will be released in aproximately 30 years. This amount is amount is minted to provide counter pressure to shocks.</p>
<p>Another 300 million FIL is held back in reserve to incentivize future types of mining. How they are released is up to the Filecoin community.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: Network Storage Baseline for Max Baseline Minting on Log Scale.</em></p>
<p>As of today 29,180,207.338966275 FIL has been slashed.This means that if a network participant misbehaves, part of their FIL collateral or potential FIL rewards is confiscated and burned. FIL is also slashed for various other reasons.</p>
<p>Considering the token release we can expect total supply of FIL token to be almost doubled in the next five years. If we look the rate of slashing so far the dilluting process will exceed the tokens burned. This makes specullating Filecoin token price risky, both for the investors and users.<sup>13</sup></p>

<section id="filecoin-and-storj-comparission" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="filecoin-and-storj-comparission">Filecoin and Storj comparission</h2>
<p>We will compare Filecoin and Storj by: 1. Consensus Algorithms</p>
<p>Filecoin’s consesus mechanism has been covered in the paragraphs above.</p>
<p>Storj does not have its own chain: the platform is built on Ethereum(currently built on PoW). The reason they decided to build on the Ethereum network is because of simplicity of using it as a method exchange. From the start Storj was never intented to be a true decentralized storage network.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Block time</p>
<p>Filecoin’s block time is thirty seconds on average.</p>
<p>Storj is the only “decentralized storage” solution to not employ their own chain. Storj decided to use the Ethereum network due to the easy deployment of a coin on it. Because of this decision, the block time is twelve seconds and needs to deal with the consequences of sharing blockchain with other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Enforcement of data retention</p>
<p>Due to the PoSt mentioned in the paragraphs above the entire network is designed around data retention. In the case of miner failing to keep his promise , the only backup of the user’s data was irreversibly lost since Filecoin doesn’t use redundancy which is also mentioned in the paragraphs above.</p>
<p>In Storj the actual enforcement of data isn’t clearly documented. Each Satellite (the interface between the storage operators and the clients) does the enforcement of data retention all on their own. Each Satellite has its own subset of storage nodes that it knows have a good reputation and it trusts, it uses these hosts to upload data to. Then it, at regular intervals, checks random data segments with “Berlekamp-Welch” error correction to make sure that the data is still there. If they fail to prove they store the data the reputation of that host is changed and data migrates to a new host. There is no chain-level enforcement for data retention.</p></li>
<li><p>Content distribution</p>
<p>In Filecoin data has to be sealed to be counted as a provable storage to the chain and because it is computation heavy it isn’t practical for the miners to serve data. 1 MiB file can take 5 to 10 minutes to unseal and 32 GiB file takes 3 hours on minimum hardware requirements mentioned above. To battle this Filecoin introduced a method to store cached and unsealed versions of data while storing the same data as sealed in order to provide proofs. This leads to the issue of miner storing the double amount of data while also posing the problem that unless the data is frequently accessed the miners will not store it because it isn’t profitable for them. That makes creating Google drive equivalent on Filecoin not practical because the data is not frequent enough to makes sense to cache while also being low latency (because of slow sealing and unsealing).</p>
<p>In Storj’s case data is being accessible only through the S3 gateway of centralized data data Satellites. Users can transform any data to public data and can send anyone a link to that data.</p></li>
<li><p>Sector size</p>
<p>Sector size is the minimum amount of data that can be sent to host and paid for. Filecoin has a fixed 32 GiB sector size. For each 256b stored 2b are proofs. Which means 1% of storage paid for is for proof. Also everything sent must be in a .car file which can be computationally heavy on the client-side.</p>
<p>In Storj’s case the sector size is not really clear. Current object fee is $0.0000022 per file stored. Which means that if there is a large amount of small files stored that would bring extra costs to the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Decentralization</p>
<p>Because of the Filecoin’s Hardware requirements for hosts that means not everyone can run a storage node. On the other networks basically anyone can run a storage node( most minimal requirements are 2 cores 8GB of RAM and some storage) but in Filecoin only people with sufficient funds for initial investments can run hosts which reduces the spread of the network. Which makes us question the actuall decentralization of the network.</p>
<p>Storj isn’t decentralized. The blockchain nature of the Storj coin is only designed for for efficient transacting not decentralized enforcement of data retention which means that Storj is actually a distributed storage provider but not fully decentralized.<sup>14</sup></p></li>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>When it comes to decentralized storage solutions Filecoin draws all the attention compared to its competitors like Storj and Sia. Storj solves Filecoin’s replication problem, on the expense of decentralization but the internet search statistics still shows that Filecoin is the main contender in Decentralized storage. <img src="https://3327.io/documents/research/posts/https:/i.imgur.com/Lr2LaBi.png" style="height: 250px; width:500px;"></p>
<p><em>Figure 3. Filecoin (blue) vs Storj (red) search interest in the past 12 months.</em></p>
<p>Even with unclear tokenomics a nd problematic durability to the writer of this research, building with Filecoin seems like the best solution when building dApps that utilize decentralized storage because of its low cost and grant opportunities, even though storage miners are somewhat centralized. If there is a way to improve current storage miner’s/clients experience on Filecoin both in cost and ease of use that would surely be a great grant opportunity. Also there could potentially be a way to draw them to a protocol that is a cheaper alternative. Ofcourse, these are all assumptions, since much of the data on these protocol is unclear and not available.</p>

  <title>Gaming DAPPs - Play to Earn model</title>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Blockchain games, also called Gaming DAPPs, are an emerging area in the Web3 space. With their gameplay, Gaming DAPPs currently cannot compete with the 3D AAA games and they mostly resemble 2D Hyper Casual Mobile games. Developers often need to make compromises in separating on-chain activity from the actions that are taken off-chain and so the line is blurred between what is truly a blockchain game and what is not. However, strong advantage of these games is that they almost always offer some form of an economic incentive to the players with an opportunity to “own” part of the game in order to influence the game’s further development.</p>
<p>The most widespread model in such games is the “Play to Earn” (P2E) model. In a P2E model, players compete against each other in earning either ERC721 or ERC20 tokens. The mechanism of token distribution varies from game to game but in general it favors those that invest more into the game and so the “Pay to Win” element is introduced. This is currently the most popular model but it has negative connotations of lacking the play aspect and focusing on just the earning potential. Games now try to pivot to what they call “Play and Earn” model with the intention of promoting the community first but also keeping the earning part going. In either way, the economy of such games seems unsustainable as it relies on the never ending stream of new players.</p>
<p>Onboarding process is also almost always a bit complex and pricy. In order to start playing, the player initially needs to bare some cost that is not constant and is decided by the market (i.e.&nbsp;buying ERC721 tokens used in the game).</p>
<p>For the gamers to accept those low quality games, those tradeoffs and a pricy onboarding process there would need to be an economic incentive and whatever the future models will be called the earning aspect needs to be present.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Gamers expect interactivity from the games they play. Once an action is taken in the off-chain games, the feedback signal is quick and the gamer knows nearly instantly the consequences of that action. Translating this experience to on-chain games is extremely difficult as every interaction that alters the state involves a transaction. Those transactions cost some amount of tokens native to the chain but they also take some time to process. This affects the whole game design process as the number of transactions that are required to advance the state in the game should be kept to a reasonable number. Having the player’s balance getting continuously decreased while playing the game and breaking the flow of it with the popup needed to sign each transaction will result in that player questioning the whole utility of that game. If the game doesn’t take this seriously into account it will lead to a bad user experience.</p>
<p>Due to current blockchain limitations, games try to cheat their way out of this by having the game logic on the server with players just signing the messages or transactions associated with their in-game actions. Splinterlands<sup>1</sup> is a popular game and an example of such practice. It is developed on the Hive blockchain<sup>2</sup> that does not support smart contracts and so the rules of the game need to be kept on the server.</p>
<p>Another successful game, Axie Infinity<sup>3</sup> takes the approach of having the players register an user account that will be linked to their wallet’s address. Almost every action inside the game is done via the PC or a Mobile client where the player has logged in with their user account. The server is in control of this game’s logic as well, which poses a huge problem because the rules of the game can be altered by the developers.</p>
<p>One important part of the Axie Infinity’s economy relies on ERC721 tokens (called “Axies”) that are used inside the game. Axies can be traded on the Axie Marketplace and are needed when minting new tokens so some players focus purely on this aspect of the game. The main game’s mechanic are “Player vs Player” (PvP) matches. The winner of the match gets some amount of game’s ERC20 tokens that depends on the player’s rank. The higher the rank the bigger the rewards. To increase their rank, players need stronger and better Axies which leads them back to the marketplace. The similar model is used across the industry, like in Pegaxy<sup>4</sup> which is a competitor game on Polygon that is currently gaining traction.</p>
<p>Because Axie Infinity was one of the first P2E games, is still relevant today and its solutions are being used in other games, this paper takes it as a study case, doing a deep dive into its inner workings.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>Being a pioneer in the space, Axie Infinity had to make some compromises. This resulted in combining the actions that are taken on-chain that include trading, minting and paying out the winnings with the off-chain actions like playing a match.</p>
<p>Having a hybrid or completely centralized approach defeats the purpose of a blockchain. The goal of this research is to understand the game’s mechanics and to try to answer the question if this and similar games can be built purely on-chain. It does this by breaking down the rules of the game and then proposing on-chain solutions.</p>
<p>In this research, there are sections dedicated to the basics of the economic model of the game. However, it is not the goal of this paper to delve deep into its problems and possible approaches to solving them. This model and its variations would require a separate research and the intention of those sections is just meant to provide context to the reader.</p>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<section id="ronin-sidechain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ronin-sidechain">Ronin sidechain</h2>
<p>The game was developed on Ethereum in 2018 by the Sky Mavis company located in Vietnam. Due to high Ethereum fees, the game’s creators moved to their own EVM compatible sidechain called Ronin which uses Proof of Authority with validators being chosen by the company<sup>5</sup> .</p>
<p>To start playing a player needs to :</p>
<ul>
<li>create their own Ronin wallet</li>
<li>create their user account on the Axie Marketplace and connect their wallet to it</li>
<li>transfer some amount of ETH and buy at least 3 Axies with a floor price of ~42 dollars per Axie</li>
<li>install a PC or Mobile app and <strong>login with their user account</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Disregarding the difficulty of the onboarding process, the whole point of a blockchain game is to have the players take actions on the blockchain. Some arguments could be made that at the time the game was developed this was needed but with the introduction of Ronin it is unclear why the whole game was not ported to it.</p>
<p>The only actions that are taken on the Ronin sidechain are dedicated to trading - buying, minting and gifting of Axies. There are no fees on Ronin, but the number of transactions per wallet address per day is limited. Deploying on Ronin, also, requires company’s permission so the development of new games and the whole Ronin ecosystem is slowed down.</p>
</section>
<section id="scholarships" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scholarships">Scholarships</h2>
<p>Market decides on the price of Axies and with a high entry cost of starting with the game, a new model of onboarding has emerged. Newcomers (scholars) can “rent out” the Axies for a certain period of time and negotiate with the owners (managers) the terms of the profit distribution. This is not a official in-game feature and is enabled by having the managers controlling the Ronin wallet and scholars controlling the user account associated with it. This leads to a bad position for the scholar as the profits are claimed by the manager and then the scholar’s share is sent to the their wallet’s address. Scholars are essentially at the mercy of the managers as their earnings and the scholarship itself can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>More fairer way of enabling Scholarships, would be to have a smart contract that would have complete control of the Axies and through which the scholars would make in-game actions. The profits would go to the contract’s address that would perform a fair split. The terms of the agreement (the minimum amount of profits to be earned by the scholar) and the scholarship’s time period would be embedded in the contract. If both parties agree, the terms could be changed later on.</p>
</section>
<section id="game-breakdown" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="game-breakdown">Game Breakdown</h2>
<p>The game itself is organized in 1v1 matches where players do not have any influence against who they will get matched. Matching is done by the server based on players’ Match Making Rankings (MMR) which is determined by the win/lose ratio of those players. All of this could be implemented in a smart contract which would keep track of all of the players’ MMRs and update them after each match. Players could start a new match or join an existing one if the absolute difference in their MMRs is under a certain threshold. The benefits of this approach is that they could also choose what match they will join or challenge a specific player.</p>
<p>Winner of each match gets some amount of game’s “Smooth Love Potion” (SLP) tokens. That amount is dependent on the MMR of that player (the higher the MMR the more SLP tokens they will win). SLP is an inflationary ERC20 token that gets minted after each match. Even though there are SLP burning mechanisms through some in-game actions, most players opt to cash out their winnings so this might not be a viable economic model. One alternative would be to have both players stake some amount of tokens in a match with the winner taking the sum of those stakes. The problem is that it introduces betting connotations and games go to extreme lengths in order to not be considered a betting game as it potentially introduces regulation.</p>
<p>Inside the game, there is also “Axie Infinity Shard” (AXS) token. AXS is an ERC20 token which has a fixed total supply. The company behind the game has roughly 20% of the total AXS supply and small amounts of AXS is distributed to the top players of the month.</p>
<p>The game makes heavy use of Axies which have certain characteristics. Players do not completely own Axies as it was discovered that the company can freeze them, making them useless. Once an Axie is frozen, it cannot be used in the game nor it can be traded on the Axie Marketplace. This possess a major concern as the players’ assets are constantly under a threat of those players being banned from the game by the Sky Mavis company. Full list of violations that will result in a ban can be seen here<sup>6</sup> .</p>
<p>Each Axie has one of the 9 classes, 4 statistics and 4 cards associated with it. Classes are grouped into three groups that form a “rock paper scissor” relationship. Meaning that, group G1 does 15% extra damage to group G2 but takes 15% extra damage when attacked by group G3. Statistics determine the Health, Skill, Speed and Morale of an Axie. This statistics affect the matches and their state transitions as the Speed for example determines the order of attacks. Cards can have positive or negative effects on an Axie as well additional effects that affect the players. Four cards associated with an Axie are added to the player’s deck when that Axie is used inside a match. More information about Axies is provided in Appendix A and the way new Axies are created is provided in the Breeding section of the Whitepaper<sup>7</sup> .</p>

<section id="matches" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="matches">Matches</h2>
<p>One match consists out of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Both players choosing a team of 3 Axies and deciding on their positions on the field (creating team formations)</li>
<li>Rounds being played out until one of the players doesn’t have a standing Axie</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Picture 1 : Axie Infinity Match View</em></p>
</center>
<section id="team-formations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="team-formations">Team formations</h3>
<p>The positioning of an Axie matters because it determines what Axie will take the damage from the enemy. Each player has 5 rows where an Axie can be positioned. The closest row to the enemy lines will be attacked first. The Axies cannot change their position and they stay where they initially were until they get knocked out. Choosing of a team formation would require two transactions per player. Those transactions would be organized in the commit-reveal scheme so that the players wouldn’t have an advantage against the opponent that naively sent the transaction revealing their team and their positions.</p>
</section>
<section id="rounds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rounds">Rounds</h3>
<p>Each Round is carried out in the following order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Players randomly draw 3 cards* from their own decks (consisting of 24 Cards**) and decide on what cards they will play</li>
<li>Cards are revealed and their affects are applied to Axies</li>
<li>Battle of the Round takes place</li>
<li>If one of the players doesn’t have a standing Axie then the match is over</li>
</ol>
<p>* Exception is that in the first Round, players draw 6 cards.</p>
<p>** There are 3 Axies per team, each Axie adds two copies for each of the 4 cards. So in total there are 3*2*4 = 24 cards in one player’s deck.</p>
</section>
<section id="drawing-of-cards" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="drawing-of-cards">Drawing of Cards</h3>
<p>Once the teams have been revealed both players know each other decks. However, they should not know what cards the opponent has in their hands and so they should not know what cards they have yet to draw.</p>
<p>One scheme that could be applied is the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have both players choose their secret “random” number and commit to it with a hash</li>
<li>Have the game’s contract ask for a random number from Chainlink’s VRF<sup>8</sup></li>
<li>Once the randomness has been fulfilled, both players know what is the order of cards they will be drawing as the seed for shuffling their decks will be some function of their own number and the received number from Chainlink’s VRF</li>
</ol>
<p>The drawing order of cards in the deck is now known only to the players. During the match, each player can play any card inside their deck and until a match ends, players trust each other that the played card was in the opponent’s hand. However, when the match ends both players would need to reveal their secret numbers as the contract needs to verify if they honored the drawing order and if the card they played at a certain moment was one of the cards they were holding. The first discrepancy would end the verification process and the cheater would be penalized.</p>
<p>One additional subproblem is that after each round the remaining cards inside the deck should be reshuffled. This could be done with requesting another random number which would help form a seed for random shuffling of the remaining cards. The verification process would need to be modified to support this.</p>
<p>Note: after all of the cards have been drawn, the deck resets.</p>
</section>
<section id="reveal-of-the-cards" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reveal-of-the-cards">Reveal of the Cards</h3>
<p>The reveal of the cards would also need two transactions per player so that one player wouldn’t just wait for the opponent to reveal their cards and then change their strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>Once cards have been revealed, before the battle takes place, the effects of the played Cards are applied. In total there are 3 constant effects (Attack damage, Defensive points and the cost of playing that Card) and 19 additional effects that a Card may have. For example, one of those additional effects are an increase/decrease in one of the Axie statistics. When multiple Cards that affect the same Axie are played, their effects are accumulated. More information about cards is provided in Appendix A .</p>
</section>
<section id="battle-of-the-round" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="battle-of-the-round">Battle of the Round</h3>
<p>Battle rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>the order of attacks is determined by the highest Speed statistic (if there is a draw then it is decided by the lowest Health and then by lowest ID of an Axie)</li>
<li>closest row with a standing Axie to the enemy lines will take the damage</li>
<li>if two Axies are inside the row taking the damage there’s a 50/50 chance which Axie will absorb the damage</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this logic could be kept inside a contract. One of that things that would need to be taken into account is that Axies attack in the pre-defined order. So during a Round, an Axie that has not yet attacked could be knocked out of the game and so the Cards associated with it, that were played in the Round, should lose their effects. Also, when an Axie gets knocked out, all of their cards should be removed from the deck.</p>

<p>Something that could be done is the introduction of “fair play” where for one round’s commit stage, one player would transmit both of the commit messages to the chain after which the other player would transmit both reveal messages.</p>
<p>If the player transmitting commitment messages decides to not transmit them, then the match is stuck. However, the game can be structured in a way such that it is in the interest of both players to resolve the match regardless of the outcome. This could be done by staking some amount of tokens that the players will receive at the end of the match.</p>
<p>If the player transmitting the reveal messages realizes he will lose and decides to not transmit them, then the first player could transmit just their own reveal message that would start a countdown for the other player to transmit their reveal message. If the countdown is reached then the player that didn’t act in the spirit of fair play is penalized in some way.</p>

<p>This scheme would give the total number of transactions of:</p>
<p><strong>Total</strong> = (1+1+2) + N*(2) + (1) = 5 + 2*N ; where N is still the number of rounds in the match</p>
<p>With the number of rounds equal to 3, the number of transactions per player is less or equal to 6.</p>
<p>This is an improvement but maybe it could be brought down further. Also, signing 6 transactions per match would still break the flow of the game, so the players would have to have a substantial financial interest in continuing to play the current match and the game itself.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Developers should keep realistic expectations on what games can be built purely on the blockchain and they should convey those expectations transparently to the end users. Proposed on-chain solutions from this research can be improved and adjusted to fit similar games. The current bottleneck of all Gaming DAPPS is the number and speed of transactions needed, so the choice of a blockchain on which the games will be built, is extremely important. Hybrid approaches, in my opinion, should not be considered, but at the end of the day, the players will decide what games will be played. The most important thing is that the rules of the game cannot change by the will of the developers. The game’s logic should be kept in the smart contracts with the source code being public. This will keep everyone honest and the players would not be at the mercy of the developers.</p>
<p>Games are meant at meant to be fun but players ought to have an additional financial benefit from blockchain games because at this moment their user experience is hindered by the current blockchain limits as well as the lower quality graphics and player involvement. Everyone involved in the P2E model should view it as an investment first. Investments can be either good or bad and they depend on every party involved contributing to the end result. Once the investment has turned bad, investors should cut their losses if there is no indication that the situation will change. In this context that would result with the players quitting the game and moving to other games which leads to a bad word of mouth and it damages the whole ecosystem. A sustainable economic model needs to be embedded in the game itself so there should not be unbound minting of new tokens. However, how exactly should that future model look like would require serious thought and it should be a topic of a separate research.</p>

<section id="executive-summary" class="level1">
<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Writing efficient code in modern languages is mostly reflected in writing efficient algorithms and business logic. Writing efficient code in Solidity is mostly reflected in thinking as an assembler, moving focus from logic implementation to memory optimisations and low level hacks. Highly optimised code may become unreadable and unmaintainable with possible bugs hidden between the lines of bit level operations. To solve this problem, this project proposes multiple automatic optimisation techniques that will be all summed up into a transpiler and Solidity language extensions called Solidity++.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Javascript introduced classes in ES6 which are very useful construct for writing clean and readable code. Browser, however, could not understand ES6 code so the code needed to be transpiled into ES5. Programmers could use classes to write logic and transpiler took care of transforming the code into an optimised ES5. The same parallel could be made with Solidity. Programmers should be focused on writing business logic in Solidity-like S++ code and the code should be automatically transpiled into efficient Solidity code. S++ should not drastically modify basic Solidity syntax, but introduce new annotations and helper functions that would enable efficient transpiling to pure Solidity code.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to improve the smart contract code on bytecode level. This project will focus on improvements on Solidity code level but the end product - optimised Solidity code will be compiled into bytecode and further optimisations on bytecode level can be performed.</p>
<p>Optimisations on code level include variable declaration ordering (state variables, local variables and structs), which correlates with the order of memory block stacking and directly influences the costs of storing the data. Some variables might occupy more space than needed to store values in ranges that require less bits than the closest Solidity data type. The most extreme example is boolean data type which stores true/false values, that could be stored in 1 bit of memory, but really use an entire byte. Accessing storage structs requires more operations than accessing a local variable, which becomes obvious problem when it is done in loops. Any fixed sized data type, like, int64, bytes32 and so on, are always cheaper than dynamic data types, such as string, and those dynamic types should be replaced with fixed ones wherever is possible (wherever the value range of the variable is known). Cost reduction can even be achieved by deleting variables - freeing blockchain space. Execution of a code that performs <em>delete</em> command on some variable/mapping value/… rewards executor with a refund of up to 50% of transaction cost, depending on the amount of freed space. There were some attempts to remove this feature (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3298) but so far it is still valid and exploitable. Usage of lazy evaluation is, an in other languages, preferred way of saving execution steps, which for Solidity directly equals saved money.</p>
<section id="existing-solutions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="existing-solutions">Existing solutions</h3>
<p>There are optimisations on loop level [1] that do not include variable level optimisations but recognise code patterns that are classified into several categories that can be automatically optimised. Also, there are papers [2] that uncover additional space for optimisation, such as removing conditions that always equal the same value or values in the loops that never change. There are also blog advices for writing optimised smart contracts, such as [3], that can and will be referenced when implementing automatisation methods.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>So far, there is no tool or IDE that either automates these optimisations or includes multiple improvements in one software. The goal of this project is to evaluate feasibility of implementing such tool and Solidity language extensions that could allow its easier implementation. End PoC toll planned as a result of this project focuses on space optimisation techniques and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing parser for Solidity language that enables language semantic and syntax analysis</li>
<li>Implementing optimisation methods:
<ul>
<li>Variable declaration reordering</li>
<li>Struct values declaration reordering</li>
<li>Defining data type extensions for storing custom-sized data (i.e.&nbsp;integers with values between 20 and 40) and implementing language parser extensions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementing generator for optimised code</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>Proto-parser for Solidity code, which includes basic PoC constructs was implemented, as well as variable declaration reordering to enable more efficient space usage; The plan is to extend the parser and to include other optimisation techniques listed in the previous segment.</p>
<section id="variable-declaration-reordering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variable-declaration-reordering">Variable declaration reordering</h3>
<p>Variable declaration reordering is a problem synonymous to binning problem, where the goal is to pack objects of a certain size into bins of fixed size <em>in any order</em> using the least number of bins. The problem is a known optimisation problem which comes from NP (non-deterministically polynomial) class and has no known efficient solution. The approach for implementing variable declaration reordering was using branch-and-bound algorithm which resulted in decent reordering time of less than 10 seconds for up to 16 variables in one block. The reordering was performed per block. The same algorithm will be performed on structs.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-type-extensions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-type-extensions">Data type extensions</h3>
<p>To enable extensions of data types there are two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining language extensions</li>
<li>Map variables to bits of memory blocks and create getters and setters</li>
</ul>
<p>New data types will be mapped to memory blocks, variables of 256 bits, on bit level using bit masks. Packing of those values will be optimised using the previously defined variable stacking algorithm</p>
<p>Proposed language extension of integer data types consists of using the existing base type (int, uint) followed by value range given in brackets. Example custom type uint&lt;10, 1030&gt; represents unsigned integer values between 12 and 98. The optimiser would determine the closest known data type that covers the range (in this case uint16). The real number of bits required to store value 1030 is 11 and the closest data type is 16 bits long which means that 5 bits are redundant. First level of optimisation may be using 11 bits mapped to a memory block of 256 bits and implementing getters and setters to interact with the value, which is casted to uint16 when used. But there is another hidden optimisation that can further improve space management. Notice that the upper limit of the interval is indeed 1030 which required 11 bits to store but the lower limit is 10 which means that total number of values is 1030 - 10 = 1020 and that many values can be stored in 10 bits of memory, so the optimisation will take into account the overall interval range and generate getters / setters that will include offsets before storing/loading values.</p>
<p>Boolean type optimisation will be straight forward and, while it will keep the type name, it will be mapped to only one bit of memory.</p>
<p>String data types would be extended with indicator of the number of characters as string&lt;10&gt; will represent fixed sized string that will be mapped to bytes.</p>
</section>
<section id="code-generation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-generation">Code generation</h3>
<p>The parser generates three-like structure of the Solidity code. Every statement or declaration is stored as an object with parameters related to the nature of the statement/declaration. For example, declaration uint256 private var1 is stored as VariableDeclaration object with attributes type=uint256, modifier=private identifier=var1. Each object contains information to reconstruct itself back to string from. This type of organisation enables easy traversal through code, easy recognition of higher-level constructs, such are infinite loops, and easy reconstruction to Solidity code (in this case - optimised code).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The feasibility of the proposed project is confirmed by implementing PoC prototype, the optimisation evaluation on the existing smart contracts is yet to come but even the simple reordering of variables that reduces the number of used memory blocks clearly shows benefits of money savings (saved memory) and time savings (eliminated thinking about such generic problem that can and should be automatised). The borderline is - it makes no harm to use it, it can only be an improvement.</p>
<p>The value of this project is assumed, but still has to be confirmed. That is why the next step of this research should be further assessment by target user group, which should include developers that are actively using Solidity in their everyday work and domain experts.</p>
