<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>NFTs are growing in popularity, and so are the numbers of transactions for transferring the NFTs on the Blockchain. One of the main features of the Blockchain is privacy, but only in terms of pseudo-anonymity. The pseudo-anonymity implies that the user creating the transaction is hidden, as he is represented using an opaque, pseudo-random address. Still, the transactions between the addresses are transparent. By analyzing the transaction graph and external inputs, such as social network posts putting the address in a specific context, it is possible to deduce the address owner and reveal all his transactions. This research aims to analyze the possibility of creating a solution that can enable NFT transfers in an environment that supports complete anonymity but is still compatible with Ethereum. The proposed infrastructure represents a zero-knowledge mixer supporting shielded transfers of the NFTs on the side chain with the ability to withdraw NFTs back on the main chain.</p>
</section>
<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Many existing solutions utilize zero-knowledge proofs to shield transactions or mix the coins and tokens. Those solutions include Zero cash, Tornado cash, Monero, and many more. The common thread connecting all of them is that they are meant for transferring currency. Although some providers (like Tornadocash [1]) announced, ZK solutions for transferring NFTs are not very popular. Unlike the currency, the NFTs are unique objects, and it is not easy nor practical to hide them in plain sight. It is possible to hide what is transferred, but it is easy to follow the trail if the thing that is transferred is unique.</p>
<p>NFTs are finding their way to the sidechains, as the Ethereum mainnet transactions often become too much overhead for minting or transferring NFTs [2]. ZK rollups like zkSync are also used for transferring and minting the NFTs [3], but the “ZK” part of the rollup doesn’t refer to privacy but compression of the transactions as a scalability solution. Bridges between sidechains and Ethereum allow NFT transfers between the chains [4], enabling cheap transactions on the side chain and final transfer back on the main chain. None of the general-purpose side chains provide shielded NFT transfers. A new solution promising shielded transfers for any assets is Namada [5, 6], Blockchain specifically built for asset privacy. With new updates of Nightfall, Polygon also announces featuring private NFT exchanges [7].</p>
<p>This research investigates the possibilities of using existing, widely adopted, general-purpose side chains to implement shielded NFT transfers. If the projects featuring shielded NFTs are scarce, a good question is if there is a market need for such a solution. The answer to this may not come from the current state of the market but the predictions of future trends. As the NFTs gain even more popularity and move from the hype-regulated market of novelties to more serious use cases, such as access control, certificate issuing, and similar, there is an indication that shielding NFTs of such documents will become a requirement. Such trends are also visible through the projects announcing future updates supporting this domain.</p>
</section>
<section id="goals-methodology" class="level1">
<h1>Goals &amp; Methodology</h1>
<p>The main goal of this research is to investigate the possibilities of implementing a zero-knowledge mixer for NFTs, using a side chain for shielding transfers resulting in a proposal of a software architecture and algorithms that would support such a system.</p>
<p>It is essential first to analyze the building blocks of similar solutions to be able to come up with a new one. A cross-chain movement of tokens is enabled using cross-chain bridges. The focus here would be on two-way decentralized bridges between two EVM chains. The two-way bridges consist of two smart contracts on each side. The role of smart contracts is locking tokens on one side and releasing or minting tokens on the other side. The contracts communicate by firing events on one side, and validator nodes that listen to those events trigger operations on the other.</p>
<p>There are two types of blockchains regarding the representation of the main currency on the chain - wallet-based and UTXO base. The wallet-based chains represent currency as a gross numerical value stored in the memory fields associated with specific accounts. When the amount <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is transferred from wallet A to wallet B, the values are updated so that wallet A has <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> coins less and wallet B has <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> coins more in the associated memory field. This logic is familiar to Ethereum users, as Ethereum is a wallet-based blockchain.</p>
<p>The chains based on UTXOs have a different philosophy. The UTXO acronym stands for “Unspent transaction (TX) output,” which may give a clue on the main structure used for representing the coins. Let’s use Bitcoin as a representative of a UTXO-based chain. Each transaction on Bitcoin requires an input amount of coins that should be transferred to the other address. The user might not see it, but the coins are not just numbers updated with each transaction, as the transactions on Bitcoin have a more strict input-output definition. There are no wallets as memory locations linked with the account, but the coins are represented as one or many UTXOs. Users own their UTXOs by having them linked with their public key and transfer them by signing the transactions using the private key associated with the UTXOs. When the user has a UTXO of five coins and wants to transfer three of them, the transaction uses a UTXO of five coins as input. The outputs of the transaction are two new UTXOs. The first one represents the transferred amount with the value three labeled with the recipient’s public key. The other is the remainder, or the unspent amount with the value two, tagged with the sender’s key. If the user has two UTXOs with two coins each and wants to transfer three coins, the user would use both UTXOs as transaction inputs. Again, the output would be two new UTXOs, one with the transferred amount for the recipient, and the other, the unspent part for the sender.</p>
<p>Systems that enable shielded transactions utilize UTXO representation for the shielded tokens even on chains that are not natively UTXO-based, as that representation is more suitable for the use case. In such systems, the UTXO values are hidden from the public and only visible to the recipient with a private key to decrypt it. The workload for computing transaction parameters is now on the sender’s side, as no other participant can see the UTXO value. The sender prepares the transaction’s inputs and outputs and generates a zero-knowledge proof that the transaction is generated correctly with proper values. The proof must confirm that the sender knows the non-encrypted UTXO value and the correct values of the resulting UTXOs after the transfer. Monero uses additional decoy values as fake UTXOs to spoof the actual token transfer and blur the overall chain of transfers [8]. Preventing double-spending is mainly done using nullifiers - values representing “coupons” for spending the UTXO. The UTXO is tied to a nullifier value, and transferring the UTXO requires the user to submit the nullifier linked with the UTXO, marking the UTXO as used. One nullifier can be used only once. When the piece of UTXO is spent, the remainder and the sent part are converted to new UTXOs with their respective nullifiers.</p>
<p>NFTs represent unique objects, so the methods used for hiding and splitting the token batches are not directly applicable to NFTs. Conversely, if the methods could be adapted to support NFTs, most well-tested algorithms and flows could be reused. Converting NFT to a UTXO-like object, called commitments, may be straightforward. The commitment may hide the token address and ID information, but the quantity value will always be one. Unfortunately, even if the quantity and token information are hidden, tracking the token in the network is easy. There is a 1-to-1 mapping between the input token and the resulting commitment. A solution to this problem may lay in decoys.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/ERFC-270/decoy.jpeg"></p>
<p>One NFT can be converted to one correct commitment followed by <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> false commitments constructed as decoys. This schema would fail when only the NFT commitment is transferred to the other user, revealing which of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> commitments was the NFT. To mitigate this problem, each transfer transaction of the NFT commitment should also include transferring <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> additional decoys to different addresses. When all participants use decoys with their transfers, the transfer graph is quickly blurred, and finding the actual NFT commitment needle in a haystack of decoys becomes difficult. One downside of this approach is a quicker filling of the commitment Merkle tree, but it can be mitigated using a bigger tree. The other is the cost increase. Under the assumption that the decoying mechanism provides reasonable privacy and anonymity, the protocol can reuse the previous building blocks to complete the system.</p>
<section id="depositing-nfts-from-ethereum-to-the-side-chain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="depositing-nfts-from-ethereum-to-the-side-chain">Depositing NFTs from Ethereum to the side chain</h2>
<p>User deposits NFTs on the Ethereum smart contract by sending a transaction allowing the smart contract to take over the NFT. On the side chain, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> commitments are minted and added to a Merkle tree. The smart contract can’t say which commitment resembles the NFT, so the commitment values need to be constructed in a specific way by the user and submitted to Ethereum smart contract. The NFT commitment should be a hash of NFT ID, NFT address, owner’s ephemeral public key, and some secret value. Other, <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span>, commitments should be hashes of a string value NULL, the owner’s ephemeral public key, and some other secret value. The user must provide ZK proof that exactly one commitment is the NFT commitment while all other <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> values are decoys. Each commitment is tied to a nullifier, generated as a hash of the commitment ID, a Merkle path of the commitment inside the Merkle tree, and the same secret value used for the specific commitment. The secrets should be different for each commitment-nullifier pair. By doing this setup, the public still doesn’t know which commitment is the NFT, but anyone can verify that one of the commitments indeed is the NFT, while others are blanks.</p>
</section>
<section id="transfering-nfts-on-the-sidechain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transfering-nfts-on-the-sidechain">Transfering NFTs on the sidechain</h2>
<p>Users on the side chain are identified using their new ephemeral keys, meaning the keys should be changed frequently. The keys are the private key, public key, and encryption key. The public key is a private key hash, while the encryption key is “the real” public key, in the sense of public-key cryptography, derived from the private key. Transferring NFTs is similar to tornado cash logic with the addition of decoys. For each NFT transfer, the user also transfers <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> other decoys to <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> different addresses. Received decoys from other users can (and should) be used in further transfers of NFTs, thus enabling further obfuscation of the trading paths. Each transfer on the sidechain is a shielded transfer, meaning that it is not performed as a regular token transfer but as a protocol backed by zero-knowledge proofs. Before explaining the protocol, let us first see how the commitment is constructed. The commitment contains two values, the commitment value, defined during deposit, and a secret value used as a salt while generating the first value. Both values are stacked in a byte array and encrypted using the owner’s public key. When the user wants to transfer the commitment, a new commitment and decoys are sent to the sidechain. ZK proof is also sent on the chain, proving that all the computations were correct. The sender proves that the new commitment is derived from the proper input commitments and nullifiers, and the output commitments are generated in the way that only one output commitment contains the NFT. The new commitment is encrypted using the recipient’s public key, so only the recipient can decrypt it and use it later. The recipient listens to the sidechain events to see if any new commitment can be decrypted using his private key and notes down all the commitments that pass the test.</p>

<section id="withdrawing-nfts-from-the-side-chain-to-ethereum" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="withdrawing-nfts-from-the-side-chain-to-ethereum">Withdrawing NFTs from the side chain to Ethereum</h2>
<p>The user who initiates withdrawal must prove ownership of the commitment representing the NFT by providing ZK proof. The user proves the knowledge of the secret preimage used for generating the initial commitment. When the proof is verified and valid, the commitment is nullified. The smart contract on the Ethereum transfers the locked NFT to the Ethereum address provided within the withdrawal request.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="results-discussion" class="level1">
<h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1>
<p>The system’s building blocks are presented in the previous chapter, and it is time to put them all together. The system architecture consists of two smart contracts, one on Ethereum and the other on the EVM side chain, and a validator network that can support the bridge between the chains.</p>
<p>The commitment format is a slightly modified UTXO Tornado Cash implementation used for TORN tokens, which benefits the protocol’s safety, as it is not an entirely new, untested concept. The strength of the protocol lies in indistinguishable commitments that are simultaneously transferred to multiple addresses. An external viewer cannot discern which of the commitments hide the NFT, as with each transfer step, new <span class="math inline">\(N-1\)</span> commitments are generated or reused and transferred to obfuscate the token trail further. The novelty introduced by the protocol lies in the initial issuing of commitments for NFT as hashes, backed by the zero-knowledge proofs, which guarantee that strictly one copy of the token is cloned on the sidechain while the other copies are decoys. The proposed name for the protocol is “The thimblerig protocol,” as it closely resembles a street con artist who tries to hide a ball by shuffling it many times under multiple, same-looking cups.</p>
<p>The downside of the protocol is the volume of commitments generated for transferring decoys and their respective nullifiers, which are stored locally in wallets. A proof of concept implementation is needed to estimate better the protocol cost, efficiency, and practical usability.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The presented protocol represents a combination of the existing protocols for shielded transfers and token mixing, adapted for NFT transfers. Generic in nature, it can be used between any two EVM chains. The next steps should include selecting the practical use cases that require the shielded NFT token transfers and evaluating the usability of the presented protocol against the selected use cases. Further research may also require a proof of concept implementation between two designated EVM chains.</p>
